            "Paragraph:    the hotel is right on the beach 10 mins walk the room really clean a bit too red for my taste but clean and thats what matters most the staff were amazing and incredibly helpful especially the manager blonde lady sorry forgot the name who allowed me to stay a few extra hours as my flight was late at night without additional charges plus everyone tried to accommodate my additional needs as a result of my disability great placethe location of this hotel is very good very nice hotel and very good staff the best one is nury from the reception she was very kind and helpful thank you for everything we totally come back soonvery cute boutique hotel with great features including breakfast buffet and towelchairs for the beach which is literally a block away very friendly staff nury definitely took care of us and recommended great options to take advantage of while in miami overall great staythis place was amazing customer service is great especially our concierge nury this place would be great for couples it is 1 block from the beach which makes it very convenient breakfast and pool were greatamazing time spent in miami hotel is conveniently located 1 minute from the beach great walking distance to the nearest walgreens and starbucks happy hour did not disappoint barok restaurant was so good my husband and i was greeted very nice and linanet helped us out with check in and was a great help alongside suellen our room was nice and cozy for a couple and the cleaning staff did not disappointnury was very helpful and very attentive with helping us check into the hotel she made sure we had everything we needed and more the ambience of the hotel is artistic chic the rooms are very spacious and have the same artistic decor the bed are so comfortable its addictive the restaurant was amazing anything we needed nury was extremely accommodating i will definitely return i highly recommend red south beach hotelthe staff was great very attentive and courteous the concierge was awesome her name is nury she and patriciazegnidaand lianett was the best we had to stay over and extra day and they were very accommodating i love them and the hotel we didnt have for anything at no pointred south beach hotelwe stayed 2 nights prior to a cruise and hotel was booked via our ta and perhaps not my first choice before travelling i had followed the comments on trip advisor and was quite anxious as to what standard i would find i need not have worried  the hotel was absolutely fine the reception staff were as others have commented extremely friendly and the hotel is about 5 minutes away from the beach there are two small supermarkets an italian restaurant a subway wine shop and a coffee shop again about 5 minutes walk  turn right outside the hotel big bus and trolley bus stop is literally across the road outside the riu hotel the breakfast for 10 was fine  yes a bit limited but what do you expect for 10 and the free cocktail was very nice  my first ever tequila sunrise which is now my drink of choice our room was the smallest on offer and it was fine  bed was extremely comfortable the room was clean and yes although tight you could sit on loohopefully i have helped others dismiss some of the negative comments written about this hotel red south beach is a lovely friendly clean well located boutique hotel book with confidence and enjoy stayed here just me and my daughter for her 12th birthday gift and the service was absolutely brilliant as a service manager myself i always judge the service being offered to me in any given environment and these guys were great from concierge to janitors and housekeeping they all greeted us with smiles and hola everyday i left my phone in the taxi on arrival and after helping me call around to find the driver who had it nuri on the front desk offered to pay the 35 taxi fare from her own pocket for him to bring it back later that day so we could go to beach and not miss out on a sunny day waiting in reception for the driver to return she and her manager zaniada also gave us breakfast vouchers on the day of my daughters birthday and secretly went to our room and dressed it with some balloons as a surprise for when we went back up this kind of service just isnt found these days if i had to balance the review and add a negative i would just say that the decor is a little odd and mishmash so if you are staying here and want to be blown away by interior design its probably not for you however if you want amazing service kind and smiling staff clean rooms decent food and a location which is just a minute walk to south beach all at a price point which this place enters at then id recommend red south beach also if youve never been to miami before and worried about location again its across the street from the beach and the miami beach trolly a free bus service stops outside and runs down to lincoln road outside mall in less than 10 minutes otherwise a 20 minutes walk overall a fantastic experience and one i hope to repeat next february to escape the dreary grey british weathervery good service  really friendly staff good beach location across the road 5 min walk to supermarket liquor store simple restaurantsvery nice interior design free bus to centre swimming pooltowells for pool  beach provided free of chargewe made 2 reservations for this hotel through groupon we arrived at 10am and nury was great she let us check in early to 1 room with no additional fee also she gave us vouchers for free breakfast the food was cold but the service was great the waitress had the chef make us some fresh pancakes since there were none left the place is cute love the egg chairs in the lobby this was al before we made it to the room go to this hotel and check in with nuryi spent 4 nights with breakfast included very nice and convenient location 5 min walking to miami beach the hotel features swimming pool and nice art decoration bedrooms are comfortable but not insulated against noise outdoors the staff is very friendly and zeinaida the manager very welcoming and service oriented and recommended us sightseeing tourstriple a is what i can say about our stay the red amazing accomodating ass kicking stafffun and friendly first i went on a quick getaway to miami to escape the freezing cold of the north what a great trip it was i really enjoyed the red for its authentic look lounge is always clean when we wait to check in the room was nicely set up and spacious the front desk staff are always smiling and helpful we also got to do some things we didnt get to last time nury the concierge booked us a city of miami tour and a trip to the everglades my wife and i were happy especially my daughter i had issues with the hot water in the room and nury helped resolve it she always greeted us with a big smile and greeted us when we came to the hotel another employee named felix helped me open the safe all in all my visit to the red was a wonderful timemy daughter loved the pool like any child would have the drinks from 5 to 7 were priced fair and while i drank my grey goose my wife had a cosmo poolside the miami scene would not be the same if it wasnt for the stay at the red as our preferred choice to stay thank you for making my family feel welcome and the wonderful experience 100 satisfied highly recommend the hotelthis hotel is great the staff is friendly and extremely helpful the free breakfast is tasty and filling nury the concierge is amazing she is nice and is very accommodating she helped us with all our needs the hotel is very clean the rooms are clean and i will be back with my husband i love it here and its not far from everything plus the price is right the bar and the pool is poppingi had a great experience rooms were spot on clean great customer service i want to thank zeneida for her awesome customer service skills love that it was quite was able to sleep with no problems comfortable beds our stay at red south beach was absolutely the best the front desk staff was great especially nury she was very helpful in accommodating my family and i also very helpful answering any questions the hotel is very clean and is in a ideal location the pool was clean and enjoyable close to buses and trolleys to explore miamis south beach i highly recommended this hotel the only thing i didnt like was having to leave thank you red south beach hotelthe staff was friendly inviting and engaged you in conversation desk offered towels and chairs and a place to change prior to checkin room was clean nicely appointed one block to the beach rate included full buffet breakfasti had the misfortune of staying at this hotel during new years because the hotels we like to stay at were sold out i honestly feel lucky to never have to ever stay in hotels like this and that the rates were higher for new years bringing in a better clientele because the day we checked out the people checking in were questionable if you let people walk into your hotel with no shirt on pants so low you can see their underwear swinging a half empty patron bottle around then good luck to you now while its a 3 star so i knew it was going to be bad compared to what im used to but this place is absolutely horrendous the beds are so hard and uncomfortable we actually woke up in pain and my neck is still sore from it now the rooms have all carpet gross there are no curtains so all you have to block light is a shutter so the only time the room is darkened is at night time and even then its not dark because of the street lamps curtains also provide noise blocking so of course you can hear everything from outside the bathroom is so small that you cannot sit on the toilet straight because your legs will hit the bath the toilet is rusted out at the bottom so it looks dirty the rain head shower is placed up so high that all you get is a little trickle so washing takes forever and almost impossible to wash long hair the corridors to lead to the rooms were so tight and dark with low ceilings it was anxiety inducing the worst part of this hotel is the restaurant inside of it  barok where employees like to steal your money i ordered a drink during happy hour which turned out to be very far from happy it was buy one get one free and the drink was 1200 when i got the check i noticed that it was not itemized and the tab was 1700 when i asked the bar tender what made it 17 he said it was taxes and fees i said ok and walked out even though i knew it wasnt right my friend was picking me up so i sat in the lobby next to the restaurant and overheard the bartender and server talking about me first in spanish and then in english because they didnt realize i was right there they were complaining about me asking why it was 17 and she shouted that she was sick of people asking why its 17 i went in the restaurant and told them i could hear them talking about me and she instantly became defensive and rude and started shouting like excuse me and i told her if she was sick of explaining to people then they should itemize the receipt so people can see clearly where their money is going you need to shut up and get the f out of my restaurant was her response to that i turned to leave because im not going to argue with some uneducated server and she said yeah thats right keep walking as i walk out this happened on december the 30th at around 530pm when i told the reception staff they apologized and tried to find the owner for me but he wasnt there and she told me if i saw him to tell him thats not my job clearly no one in this hotel cares about hospitality and they need to take a serious look at their employees because that isnt how to treat anyone disgusting my husband parents and i stayed for 5 days over christmasi felt the price was reasonable for the 3 rating relative to miami being expensive anyway and the xmas spikelets start with the positivesthe location was great  across road from the beach and near enough to the attractions of south beach without being bang in the middle  and the hotel had a nice pool deck area bright foyer  restaurant and small gym it was clean and breakfast went on until 1030am which was helpful our room was quiet as it didnt face the street but my parents had some noise we had beach towels and chairs every day and for those who like a happy hour drink youre in luck  free one every day 57pmhowever its in need of maintenance we were disappointed on arrival one of the lifts was out of service the other  even given increased use  was extremely slow we had trouble connecting to wifi and it was off and on my parents air con was too cold and couldnt be turned off there was no tea making facilities in the room but being english in the us perhaps were expecting too much the breakfast was ok if you enjoy carbs and heavier food but could have had more fruit muesli etc it wasnt included in our bookingcom price either we would have liked to use the pool but it didnt seem heated or warm enough to swim inthe gym was tiny and in a room with no windowsit was unfortunately that some of the maintenance issues happened over xmas when it was probably hard to find available handymen although all hotels should have them however once we complained my husband and i were given a free bottle of bubbly breakfast included and 1 free night which we appreciated so because the staff were obliging and rectified our complaints overall we felt it was a good experience and we would be happy to recommendi stayed at red south beach last year i would definitely recommend this hotel to others the location is perfect just a few minutes walk to midbeach boardwalk and bus the staff was great nury and zenaida at the front desk were very accommodating and helpful and recommended some great restaurants in the area and south beach towels were readily available and they always had water in the front foyer to refill your bottlethey also offered complimentary happy hour and breakfast was included i had no issues with my room it was always clean and stockedgreat value for the location hospitality and pricewe spent a few day very comfortable in a quiet and pleasant place i highlight the kindness of zenaida and dayana that with their sympathy and kindness made the stay more enjoyable it is highly recommendedstayed here for two nights over christmas breakfast was appalling customer service was non existent and most staff need customer service training worst staff i ever experienced in any hotel resort charge was not explained and when i made the booking wifi was free so this was unnecessary only one lift working which resulted in long delays i have nothing good to say about this hotel but the location great hotel amazing staff super nice location for a quiet and fabulous week with the beach just a block away from the hotel zenaida alvarez went beyond any expectations making us feel like we were part of her family she was more than special and her customer service was perfect defenitly she was the sweetest person on staff i also want to mention nury gomez that she always was there to help us with any questions we had she is very sweet and made us feel like home thank you to everyone who made our stay so peaceful and enjoyable i would definitely recommend itmy stay at the red was amazing i couldnt be happier rooms were very clean and the customer service was amazing and special thanks to mayka amazing young lady very outgoing and funny  will visit again i really enjoyed my stay the staff was very pleasant great location beach across the stree great hotel decor breakfast every morning was good appetizers and drinks at night by the bar there was also a lovely patio to sit outside and take in the fresh airnice comfortable quirky hotel across the road from a lovely sandy beach rooms a decent size with coffee making facilities iron ironing board and toiletries in a quietish area but a good half hours walk from the livelier area with lots of shops restaurantsstaff were very helpful and mostly pleasantthe young lady nury at the front desk was very helpfulthe food was great and we were able to walk to the beach i believe it was a 23 minute walk also i loved the art work on the walls very colorfulhotel is clean room spacious but bathroom very small excellent air conditioning decor very questionable but humorous two extremes with staff some will go above and beyond to help you and others are rude and unwilling to help breakfast is included basic but enough to keep you going til lunch pool is small with sun loungers but we never had a problem getting a sun lounger it is a 3 min walk to the beach 2030 min walk to the centre of south beach however there is plenty of transport options we used to get the free miami beach trolley which brings you right to the center we were supposed to stay here for a 2 night stop over before going on a cruise for this purpose this hotel is ideal however on our trip we ended up staying in miami an extra 3 nights so for a 5 night stay i probably would have looked for nicer accommodation but for a short stay id recommend this hotelfriendly and helpful staffvery lively yet family friendlyrooms are really clean and coolgreat air conditioninga neccesity with the humide climatebest pizza in miamithank you for the best miami experiencemay husband and i stayed at this hotel after a cruise the hotel was close to a bus stop that had buses stop by every 20 minutes you could walk to a path that parallels the beach the breakfast was decent i would recommend this hotelwe stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon the hotel is really cozy and clean and the staff is very attentive to customer needs especially lianet at the reception was really exceptional and kind and helped us to solve an important problem with our shuttle bus to the airporti enjoyed the hotel very much and also the restaurant inside of it the food was of good quality and at good price personalized attention and the manager luigi very nice the front desk supervisor nury is very attentive and her team always smiling you feel at home in this hotel and we will come back sooni looked for the restaurant of this hotel but didnt find it since we arrived the hostess was not very friendlybut we ignored this we were a table of three and ordered a pizza and the salmon only two dishes after over an hour of waiting one of us asked the hostess who said she would check what was going onbut were pretty sure she forgot our order because within 15 minutes of that we had our food the salmon with mashed potatoes my friend had was tasteless and overcooked at least they didnt charge us for this dish since she refused to eat it this is the only reason i am putting two as a rating instead of one but unfortunately she had to go to bed hungry because by the time we were done everything else was closed our pizza was not horrible but it wasnt great either service in general was badafter we ate we had to go inside because the waitresshostess didnt even come to check on us we are never coming back here and we suggest you do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant again this is just a review for the restaurant not the hotelhace muchos aos que paro en ese hotel y realmente estoy muy conforme con la atencin las habitaciones la limpieza y todo en general muchas gracias al gerente luigi rsula y mercedes de reservas  nuri y zenaida de front desk jos augusto del vallet parking y a todos en general lo recomiendo i have been staying at this hotel for many years and i am really happy with the service the rooms the cleaning and everything in general thank you very much to the manager luigi rsula and mercedes for reservations nuri and zenaida for front desk jos and augusto vallet parking and all in general i recommend this hotel i chose this hotel for the fact that they offered a hot breakfast every day that you stayed there now anyone who knows me knows i take my breakfast very seriously do not give me a cookie or a cupcake and call it a day this ended up being the biggest disappointment with my stay breakfast is 730 to 11 and i would get down there about nine and the food was more than halfway gone the first morning i came down i assumed they would be refilling the empty stations that were there there was one tray of scrambled eggs another tray that had three sausage links in it and a third tray that was empty while i was at breakfast no one refilled the food they had a waffle iron to make waffles but if you werent in the mood for a waffle you were out of luck  they also routinely ran out of flatware and plates during the breakfast hours you were left there waiting until someone came in to replenish these needed utensils they seemed to be short staffed throughout my fiveday stay the one bartender was also the person who made bloody marys and mimosas in the morning bussed tables inside the restaurant and also bussed tables outside by the pool also the first night i was there i went down to the restaurant for dinner something light when i asked for the chicken wings i was told that anything that needed to be fried was not available i dont know if their fryer broke but the salad with grilled chicken that i had instead was a not a very good substitute my room was nice large and clean my bed was very comfortable the furnishings and decor seemed to be on the chintzy side but that is something you have to deal with when you do not go with a chain hotel while i was there two of the days my room was never made the first time i called the front desk and they sent someone the second time i just said forget it and dealt with it any of the staff that i interacted with were very nice and accommodating the bartender was a very hard worker so i hope she is compensated accordingly i made sure i added to her tip jar when she waited on me  overall i had a good time while visiting miami this little hotel could do so much too heighten their visitors experience while staying there i hope that they do soi had a very nice experience at red south beach hotel very comfy beds great breakfast a couple blocks to the beach staff was super nice and helpful elevator smelled musky but it worked  the only complaint i have is the glass shower door in the room it doesnt slide open like normal glass doors you have to go inside the tub to turn on the water which was strange not sure if all the rooms are the same but overall great experiencelianet is the best receptionisthotel is good located and the breakfast is goodi will come back for sure hotel is located in collins avenue and not far from the beach 100 meters and 20min walk from ocean drivethis place is awesome from the drinks staff rooms to the all you can eat included breakfast beach was right across the street great price for the location with near by cultural related resturants we loved south beachnury the concierge was simply amazing so nice and easygoing the hotel is a little older and my only complaint is there is a strange smell in the hallways but with that being said i was very pleased with my stay here close to everything on south beach and like i said the staff was so nice from hector the door man to nury and patricia the bartender i felt very appreciated the whole time i was there thank you to the whole staff and i will see you on my next visit amari smithmyself and my partner had booked a week stay well aware that it was a cheaper alternative to the hotels around they gave us complimentary breakfast which we found to be self service which again is not a problem as you get what you paid for one morning we went down to have breakfast as usual we were confronted by a very unorganised layout there were facilities to make waffles however there was no assistance as the machine seemed to be malfunctioning when we asked the manager he went onto explaining it was self service but we only just needed assistance really we then went ahead and sat down trying to have what we found the manager approached us and said hed like to know why we were asking who the manager was and what the problem was while we ate our breakfast he abruptly disturbed us i tried to explain that ill speak to him after wed finished eating but he was very insistent to know what went wrong which we found to be incredibly embarrassing as well as unprofessional other hotel guests were looking over at us and that is clear defamation i would recommend this hotel if you are not looking to spend much and the cleanliness of the rooms were okay too however it is over priced for the facilities provided and the management needs to review their customer servicei stayed with my family in this place my son recommended it to us it was our first time and really a stay to be remembered the rooms were very nice  clean and very comfortable and people were very nice and friendly and always ready to help and answer to our questions and needs breakfast was amazing i wouldnt miss it for nothing it was fresh just prepared and served with care definitely we will be back againhow this hotel has got good reviews is beyond me i stayed for 4 nights and hated it was gutted that i had 4 days before my flight home if you like plastic knives and forks then youre in luck if you like a mish mash continental breakfast which apparently is included in your booking fee then go for it if you like dark corridors to your room then this is the place for you if you dont mind paying out for expensive meals and eating basic food then again this is the place for you the rooms are basic the website photos must be old as there are very little similarities compared with the real picture i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the only good thing about this hotel is the location to the beach i booked the hotel through a vacation app i have secretscapes and was thoroughly happy with our visit when i booked the hotel i didnt take into account that it was going to be spring break in miami beach fl we arrived and the hotel at 11am and went to the desk to ask if there was possibility of an early check in they explained there wasnt any ability to do that but we could check our bags with them grab some beach towels complimentary and head to the beach for a couple hours if we wantedwe got changed in the bathroom and left the bags collected our towels and headed out for some sunwe were coming from philadelphia area in mid march so lots of sun was in orderthe front desk crew were always courteous and helpful the overnight desk guy was always so friendly and happy to see us always a smile on everyones faces we checked in and rested a bit then headed down for the complimentary drink mica at the bar was so friendly and helpful and just a really fun energetic person to be around and chat with at night we made our way down into the madness that was miami beach spring break i cant even comment on this as im sure most people have heard stories about this years goings on after deciding that the lights and sirens and crowds of people all of them probably 20 years younger than myself and my partner were all a little too much crazy for us we went back toward the hotel grabbed a 6 pack of beer up the block and headed to the front sitting area of the hotel where we met benjamin and the other doormen this became our usual hang in the evenings for the rest of our trip as they were such great people and just fun to be around we were there for 4 nights and the accommodations were a fun little change from your usual everyday hotel the lobby mostly in white with bright red accents was a delight the cleaning crew kept the areas gleaming through all the traffic of people in and out an impressive feat in itselfthe morning breakfast offerings were adequate however made things a little less interesting for a vegan but they did have fresh fruit and juice and toast only suggestions i could make would be to have maybe another protein available even just peanut butter for those who dont eat animal protein also for the ones who do it always seemed as though the food was gone or nearly gone and took a while to fill back up the young lady working the breakfast detail was hustling around and was always sweet and helpful and kind and works her butt off there all of the workers are constantly moving and grooving at no time did it seem like any of them were bored or had nothing to do the ownermanagers pointed out to us incidentally because we had overheard a conversation between workers was always friendly and available to the staff they were also quick with a smile or handshake this kind of service is a dream for me when youre on vacation who wants people who are in a bad mood serving or helping them we get enough of that in the cityanyway thank you so much for being so wonderful and if we ever find ourselves in miami beach again be sure we will stay there but most definitely not during spring breaki have been in this hotel for 3 days during an exhibition in miami and i chose it because was quite close to the exhibition center and also to lyncon road when i visit a new hotel i try to understand what is being the style the concept etc but in this case i was not able to provide any replies to my questions the building is very hold even if white painted gives a different impression the staff speaks differs t languages rooms are quite big they have all the amenities but need lot of maintenance because are suffering for broken parts missing parts etc bathrooms are small and really more than the rooms need a lot of maintenance lot of broken parts scratches noise insulation is something very bad i have seen just few other situations like that you can hear people talking in the rooms next to you the temperature of the ac cant be adjusted or you get frozen or ovewarm the blankets of the windows are too small breakfast is cheap and really essential the price of the hotel is too high vs the quality and service only one good and positive points the speed of the internet connection and the kindness of the staff there are other solutions for sure in miami i was really hoping to love this hotelwe are locals and were always looking for a nice hotel on the beach to have staycationsunfortunately this will be our first and last time at this hotelworst part is that it wasnt even about the service we received but the room we were givenit looked nothing like any of the pictures listed hereall the updated showers wood floors updated wood vanities did not exist in the room we were given and the worse part is that when we were checking in the front desk told me they were giving us one of their best roomsvery upsetting experiencehere were the issues we encountered room quality was poor door to the room was located directly in the stairwell we were warned that it was by the stairwell but not clear that the entry was within the stairwell where you had to go through the stairwell door to get to the room door room smelled musky and it may have been because of the carpet in the room plus the ac issues in that room ac was not working upon arriving it was temporarily fixed however upon check out the next day the thermostat was starting to read high temps again beds were comfortable but sheets had a little bit of an odor bathroom sink had some black mold on the rim wall corners looked dirty chair in the room had dried up residue on it pool was very very cold could be because of the weathernone heated pool but when sitting in the pool area looking up at the roof you saw some broken lights and worn outwe had an early check in and during the time of check in the front desk clerk assured that we were being given one of the best rooms in the hotel but considering the above mentioned issues we received far from a great roomthe only positive experience we had there were the friendly valet workerswe really wish we had a better experiencemy girls and i definitely enjoyed our stay at this hotel our room was right next to the pool which was perfect only downfall is that you have to walk a couple blocks to get to ocean drivewhich is fine if you dont mind walkinglovely hotel with a great location and extremely helpful and friendly staff from the staff at the concierge to the valet gentlemen especially jose our overall experience was fantastic would definitely stay againid stay again nothing fancy and value for money food is burgerwings style pleasant casual poolside tables plus a few indoors good breakfast short walk to beach and not too far from anywhere by uberthoroughly enjoyed our recent precruise stay at the red south beach lovely spacious room small but functional bathroom plenty of storage space the pool area is small but with the beautiful beach just a few minutes stroll away it wasnt a problem and there were always beds available when we chose to sit by the pool breakfast was ok the daily free cocktail was a nice touch would stay here again if we return to south beach came on a baecation this boutique hotel is gorgeous not too far from the night life right across the street from the beach our room was great right off the pool with a separate entrance to hotel great for a nice discreet entry n exit the staff were greatclean locationlianett n nury the front desk staff were friendly n very helpful n my room was decorated for my bday which included some champagnewill returni want to say i am pleased with nury nury was very accommodating she listened to all of my wants and needs and followed through i also want to thank my housekeeper she was so sweet she changed my linens when i needed a fresh set all the staff katiana eric  benjamin were all soo great to me thank you red south beach nydianice hotel along collins the room has reasonably priced and exactly what i was looking for on a one evening sleep over in the area thrilled that they had parking and it was not over priced also the mornings breakfast hit the spot elevators are a bit slow but otherwise ideal place to stayi love staying in miami beach when i come visit family in miami but i had never stayed at red south beach what a pleasure it was to discover this super cute boutique hotel right across the street from the beach and it has a pool the staff was super friendly and so accommodating with late check outs and storing luggage my room was exactly what i needed and very clean will definitely be checking in again soonmy husband and i stayed at this hotel because it was close to the beach the beach is one block away our stay was really nice the staff warm and friendly on our first night we had a small issue with the room and the girl in front didnt get her name

            "Paragraph:    i staid at the hotel last weekend and it was truly a great experience the hotel and rooms were beautiful the staff was extremely friendly i will definitely stay again at the hotel next time i go to miami beach 100 recomendeda beautiful hotel the staff was friendly and helping the room had all the necessities and was in spotless conditions the hotel is in an ideal location it is only a 5 minute walk to the beach if you didnt bring chairs or umbrella the hotel has a designated spot on the beach that provides them had a fun stay with my friends and definitely will be coming backloved this hotel it was very clean and well decorated had great amenities pool free beach towels and beach chairs free bikes free drink upon arrival etc excellent staff and great service its located just a short walk form the beach 4 storey building we were lucky to get a rooftop terrace with panoramic city views very low carbon impact is a feature of this place very walkable to ocean drive for the beach and lincoln road for the shopping luis on the front desk deserves a special mention he could not have been more helpfulthe hotel is nice and modern and very on trend the rooms have everything you need and nothing you dont need the staff are friendly and helpful location is ideal a very short walk to the action when i come back to miami i will be staying hereexcellent hotel modern design beautiful location near the beach only 10 minutes walk from ocean drive the staff were competent and friendly lovely facilities nice relaxing swimming pool rooms are very clean comfortable and modern free coffee and water are available throughout the day i will definitely stay again at the hotel next time i travel to miami beachwe really enjoyed our stay at urbanica clean and perfect location close to the beach and restaurants the hotel offers free bikes and beach beds breakfast is very good considering the price 10 but there could have been a better selection of greens tomatoes cucumber etc and bacon andor ham the service is excellent and they actually took care of our luggage one extra night when we were in key west amazing chic little hotel brilliantly located for miami beach staff are wonderful rooms stylishly simple  spotless nice little pool they redefine the concept of a minibar im not explaining  just visit probably the best feature is the loan of bikes free to go off  explore i cant praise the hotel enough  excellent value for money too thanks to james  all the teamthis is a small hotel that makes a lot of use out of limited space our room was very clean albeit smaller than most us luxury brand hotels think typical european brand hotel while smaller the room did not lack for amenities there was a small desk enough electrical outlets a closet and the bathroom had well thought out features there is a common room which has comfortable seating area and a projection tv which seems like a great idea until you realize there are guests that are going to party their asses off until 300 am that and the fact that our room was in front of the housekeeping closet and elevator and housekeeping was super loud while we were trying to sleep in a bit after a long trip out from the west coast the free bike rentals were awesome and the front desk was very helpful the cafe downstairs was great very european once again great location with free beach towels to sum it up this hotel is major bang for your buck and i will definitely return here again except i will complain about the noise next time im confident they will handle it appropriatelypositive very friendly staff great location super comfortable beds rooms have very good sound noise isolation negative disorganized checkin process has to wait almost two hours for a room in spite of arriving at 3pm they did makeup for it by giving some cocktails and snack for me one of the best experiencies in miamilocated in the beggining of south beach for me the area most preserved if you dont require crazy party all day longvery close to brickell and midtown area just a bridge of distance 510min maxfancy bikes to ride all over sb and beach service includedtowels chairs etxthe bar minibar is a must to start the night amazing decoration and drinksthe breakfast area is really cool and combine healthy food option with good serviceyou find design in every corner of the hotel really good tasteeven is it not a 5 stars hotel you will like it isthe service in the one that you want need to receive everybody smile and were kind with youextremely recommended will back for surevery nice poolarea supreme location the room was lacking adequate lighting which made reading in bed impossible and packingunpacking too complicated the day of arrival during traveling we received a mail informing us that our two rooms had been cancelled without further notice very frustrating of course the staff could help us though since we reached them in time not entirely clear what caused this the receptionist could not explain what had happened at arrival the staff was also a bit hostile due to the fact of mixups as to which traveling party that should be accommodated in which room this i find very surprising with two parties one couple and one 4member family and two rooms one 2bed and one 4bed didnt try the breakfast drinks at the bar were ok but didnt go further than that overall ok would not recommend it specifically based on this stayamazing quick stay before a cruise complimentary drink wonderful 10 breakfast clean crisp modern room amazing staff sexton the manager even walked us out made sure we were happy young staff lady showed us around walk to beach definitely worth visitingi had my birthday celebration back in november 2018 and even tho it was postponed 1 month original date october everyone was really helpful and me and my friends received the best personal treatement in miami beach and their bar minibar was the perfect place to celebrate my bdayour stay was amazing the hotel has some modern flare to it staff is excellent upon arrival they gave us free mimosas rooms are very clean service was great they also gave us a complimentary chilled bottle of champagnethey have an outdoor pool which can be used all hrs of the day and night and its located on the top floor we would swim in the evening and it was very romantic with the view of the stars and the moonhotel is located just 15 mins awaywalking distance to south beach we loved walking to the beach because there are restaurants and shops along the way i highly recommended this place if you are visiting south beachwe spent two nights here in feb 2019 very convenient location clean rooms and great service breakfast buffet was good and complete close to art deco hotels on ocean ave two blocks to the beach pet friendly the room was moderna bit sterile nice television this was a busy hotel and so could not check in early directions were given to big red bus but they were incorrect nice basic breakfast for 10 good location we walked to restaurant we enjoyed our stay the pool is small but relaxing and there is a room off the pool that is quite peaceful definitely not what i would consider a resort rather tired of all the additional costs to travel these days including this resort feevery nice ambiance close enough to walk everywhere but in a quieter local neighborhood lots of restaurants nearby the whole hotel and the rooms are very clean the staff is very helpful their breakfast and sandwich bar offers very tasty fresh and affordable breakfast and lunch optionswe stayed here on business recently the rooms were very clean but on the small side we were transatlantic travellers so had quite a bit of luggage most of which had to stay in our cases having said that the staff made up for any shortcomings in the actual building they were truly brilliant and could not do enough for you the breakfast was quirky but very good value and once again the staff were great lovely little pool and chill out area and lots of free bikes to take out whenever you wished although no lights for nighttime a short walk to the beach and good value for moneyoh my gosh im in love with this boutique hotel everything about it from the modern decor to the clean rooms great prices and the absolute best staff ever made this hotel a stay i will never forget we love this place and all the people that work here the hotel is first class and close to the beach we are always greeted with a welcome home from the manager sexton jamison at the front desk a fine canadian fella always takes the time to inquire how our trip down here was and how are things are in canada all the staff are attentive and the amenities are clean and new with comfy beds i must say my wife and i travel around the world and meet lots of great people but we have yet to find a place like the urbanica in miami sexton and jamison are the real reasons we come back here if i were the ownership group id make sure these fellas were on some sort of profit sharing because its people like this that make business profitable norman  elizabeth ferris british columbia canada friendly helpful staff clean and tasteful rooms the tile in the bathrooms is beautiful and a funky overall property decent rates in a really hot neighborhood walk to beach whole foods ocean drive collins ave planta great restaurant lincoln road and miami beach convention center complimentary lobby coffee and fun lobby cafe i have stayed here three times and will definitely do so againsecond stay at the urbanica and it wont be the last this time we were really spoilt as had a free upgrade to the best room in the hotel room 408 at the very front of the hotel at the top with a balcony  terrace around three sides room was large with full length windows around the whole room it was very quiet as we had no neighbours or passing foot traffic so we were in heaven a wonderful hotel lovely friendly staff in a perfect location 5 minutes away from the madness of ocean drive will be backexcellent hotel well located super location near the beach one of the most beautiful beaches in south miami and near the best restaurants in town only 12 streets from lincoln road and good access to buses or trolley to go to differentnplaces the amenities od this hotel is great as well as the breakfast food and coffee there is also a minibar that serves very good drinks i will come back no doubt top ranked we had a pleasant experience from beginning to end between the free bikes and welcome mojitos to the location and the hotel itself we only had great things to say about our stay will definitely be staying there again when we go to miami beach its not just because of the two welcome mojitos the neverending smiles and handshakes and complimentary this and that its not just because of the comfortable beds the essential oils misting thruout the hotel property the peaceful rooftop swimming pool retreat and adjacent chill room the hip bikes locks and helmets provided the generous beach towels and beach chaise lounger service tip the esteban chair boys theyll be nicer its mostly becuase they freakin care that you are truly 100 satisfied my girlfriend alicia and i were treated vips we also heard the same from the equally chill and super fun guests from london amsterdam and sao paolo our new friends had the very same things to say we booked a basic room facing the courtyard and truthfull it was too small the front desk crew tried to offer us an upgrade we didnt even ask but couldnt get us upgraded for the 3 days in a row so we kept our room thanks sexton garcia just one of the exceptional team members thanks freddy lucca william james laura luis a very huggable housekeeper the ladies who run the excellent lobby cafe with sensational empanadas avocado toasts and a ridiculously chunky and yummy pok toast with an almost gulpworthy sirachamayo dressing yum owners please ensure that all of the above and the rest of the team get recognized see yall soon viva urbanica bammm chuck and alicialively lovely hotel staff was great loved the decor filled with greenery overall truly amazing especially for the price they sent champagne to my room for my birthday chairs on the beach were included bikes and helmets available at your lesisure good distance from the beach 3 blocks i come to miami once or twice a year and normally would stay at a new hotel each time theres so many to choose from so i like checking out the variety but i always picked something directly on the ocean my first visit here was in august 2017 and decided to give this a chance because my prior years stay at a very trendy hotel was quite disappointing not worth the money this wasnt beachfront but the plunge pool looked amazing and the beach was only a short walk away sooooo happy i chose this place and have since returned in aug 2018 the staff are really warm and helpful and the general manager made time to speak with me each time ive actually never headed to the beach when i stay here because i love the pool and cabana area so much food and drinks are delicious and thoughtfully prepared not your standard burger and fries which is a plus in my book they also have a small romantic lounge for cocktails at night beds are really comfortable with crisp white linens i dont plan on staying anywhere else in miami except their new hotels opening down there part of me doesnt want the secret of this boutique hotel to get out because its a true gem keep up the good work the rooms are small with very thin walls the staff is friendly and helpful to your face but stitch you up later i arrived with my family and at the time of check in they asked me for my credit  debit card and did not think anything of it as it was quite normal so that they may charge to it for all your consumptions during your stay but soon discovered they had charged for the rooms again to the card so i realised i paid twice for it they promised me this would all be refunded when i check out but after a few long discussions and arguments i gave up and hoped this would be refunded this did not happen until i raised a complaint through hotelscom whom i used to book through hotelscom refunded me some money but i suffered exchange loss later the hotel charged me for some random amount which till this day they have not explained i have written emails to the manager sexton he replied to one and promised to look into it but not heard back after several emails it is quite frustratingthis is a nice hotel clean and bright in keeping with the miami style super close to the beautiful beach the parking charges are absolute extortion but not out of step with the rest of the city and theres a resort fee which im never cool with  just build it into the cost and be done with itthe reception and breakfast area are really small theres a little bar attached at the side which is also tiny but cute however the cocktails are awful i tried three different ones and they were really poorthe room was comfortable and clean and i couldnt have asked for anything else from a two night stay there are nice restaurants around and its close to a walgreens and cvs i highly recommend staying here the location is excellent as it located in the south of 5th district and not part of the madness of ocean drive the hotel is beautiful and has an amazing mini bar located on the ground floorurbanica hotel located from side at very nice and quiet street and form the other side in great location at miami south beach the staff was very nice at the check in and the room are big and clean at the lobby they served free complementary drink very friendly and helpful staff providing good advice on restaurants or visits very flexible and responsive great team  excellent location near the beach and ocean drive nice welcome drinks offered to us and a polaroid picture i recommendthe hotel had great service and perfect location we especially liked the possibility of using the free sun beds on the beach just a few blocks awaythe rooms were spacious and modern with comfortable bedsthe service of this hotel is exceptional we had never experienced such level of service anywhere else in the usoverall  by using this hotel you get value for moneyif we should be pointing at some improvementsthe rooms have quite small windows we tried both the queen size room and king size room there is basically no difference except for the bed size  despite the cost difference but we liked having rooms located inside  not towards the streetthe cleaning of the room is good  but  they did not change the bed sheets for four days and the bed side tables were always standing far away from the bed after they had been cleaning the roomthe towels had occasionally some spots and dirt on them when we got them  both for the room towels and the beach towelsthe pool and pool area is limited to a very small areamy stay was amazing let me start with the smell as you walk in and the warm welcoming from the front desk staff it has a european chill vibe to it and during check in you get a free drink which was really good the hotel provides you with bicycles which we used a lot since everything was short distance from the hotel including ocean drive and the beach our room also had a great smell to it everything was very clean and nice there is a minibar very cute and classy every staff member made us feel very welcomed and at home but i will say our favorite was definitely luis who works the front desk the pool and pool area is also very nice with lounges no the hotel is not right next to the beach but you still get beach lounges and towels our flights were before and after the check in and check out times and they were nice enough to hold our bags breaksfast is offered for low fee compared to all the other restaurants in south beach we absolutely loved our stay and we will definitely stay here again i recommend this hotel to everyonethe hotel was super clean overall room was nice  cool temperature at all times location is incredible close to ocean drive but far enough where its away from the craziness staff was beyond amazing friendly informative kind  thoughtful definitely a hotel to recommend to anyone will be coming back here without a doubtmy boyfriend and i stayed at urbanica for just a night before heading to another hotel for a work conference the room was spotless with an amazing view the staff was kind we had breakfast included but opted to eat out and looked for a less carblevel breakfast we also got a welcoming mojito very close to all stores and the beach highly recommendedthe rooms are clean and in good condition everything is working first registration in wifi was not so easy we had to go to reception area to make it working you can go by walk to ocean drive the beach you can borrow bikes for free breakfast buffet is not big but with quality products we appreciated it i would come back this hotel and recommend it to my friendsamazing hotel and staff we have stayed here 2 times this year exellent service free bicycles nice and clean rooms 5 min walk to the beach and 5 min walk to the beautiful marinathe area is nice and calm we will be back soonawesome place location was perfect and most importantly all the staff were outstanding special thanks to isabella luis and james ill be back to miami soon and will only choose urbanica thank you everyonethis hotel was perfect for my memorial day weekend in miami it is about a 5 minute walk from the beach in very close walking distance to restaurantsbars that we wanted to try plus its a close walk to the world erotic art museum i loved not having to blow all my money on ubers plus being slightly away from the beaten path the street noise was kept to a minimal which i was not expecting the staff are so friendly and the hotel is so clean  beautifully decorated i had a great time and would definitely stay here againi am quite picky about hotels and for my first time to miami i chose urbanicait didnt disappoint as from the moment we arrived the staff were really nice welcoming and more importantly smilingthe check in was easy and everything explained really well breakfast was at the cafe right at reception for 10 per person which is really good value you can also help yourself to coffee anytimethe room was well appointed and clean and the one thing that sticks out at me about the hotel is that it smells really nice with a lovely fragrancethe pool all be it small was ideal and a chill out room next to it along with a vending machine and icewater machineswe didnt get chance to have our free cocktails and free bike rental but again some nice touches urbanicas staff were the real selling point though so thankyou to them for accommodating us and should i come back to miami then this will be my basewe stayed at urbanica for 3 days and loved almost everything about it its a stylish hotel with super friendly staff and good affordable breakfast we really liked the location of the hotel just a few blocks away from ocean drive and the beach on our last day we were allowed to use a room to take a shower and get dressed before leaving to the airport which was a very nice serviceonly thing we could complain about is the rather thin walls of our room and the fact that you cannot conrol the ac apart from turning it on and off it wouldve been nice to turn down the fan a bit as it was quite cold during the nighti have been to this hotel for a 5night stay during a business trip everything was nice and wellkept very different from those huge hotels in which guests are just numbers a huge plus was how they handled a minor setback not even due to them but to an external service provider without going into details they did everything into their power to solve the small issuethe place looks and smells so pretty check in was fast  easy accommodated for my birthday w cake champagne  balloons beds are soft rooms modern its clean walking to shoppes close by outside courtyard is perfect will be back staff was amazing before and after checkout great location literally walking distance to any and everything on south beach  prime real estate on south beach i will definitely be back  no doubt  thanks for such a great stay honestly one of the cutest spots in miami and in an amazing location close to beach and clubs great vibes loved minibar and the coffee bar in the reception area sexton and team were gracious hosts would 1210 stay againthe meridian was one of the best experiences we had in miami the staff was so kind and accommodating the drinks were wonderful food was delicious lobby is instagram worthy rooms were cozy sexton was the best part of our experience here he made sure we felt special thank you guys for the amazing experience well be recommending this hotel to our friends and family when they visit miami we just had a little stay but the service was incredible nice and symphatic they gave us really good tips what to do and eat not a expensive but very very nice place to stay in miami near to everywhere quite in the night and the pool ist actually in this hotel not like in other hotels in miamithis boutique hotel is ig and decor goals affordable compared to other hotels considering its still in the main part of sobe and just a short walk from the beach the lobby cafe has a limited menu and is a tad pricey but so is everything in miami get the beef empanadas who wouldve known id find my favorite empanadas in the lobby of my hotel the staff was also very friendly and accommodating esp the front desk i didnt get to drink at the bar but it looked super cute the chill out room by the pool was also clutch when i had to do a little work during my trip my only gripes were paper thin walls you can hear everything my advice if youre actually trying to get some sleep in miami is get a top floor room if at all possible or at the very least not right over the barlobby here you can hear the music from below speaking of walls not only were they barren  they were dirty i didnt mind the minimalistic rooms but it would help a lot of they just repainted the walls lots of marks and scratches that made the place look run down lastly our cleaning service wasnt consistent sometimes they gave us new towels sometimes they didnt and there were beach towels on the floor that were obviously used but they didnt takeregardless i would probably stay here againthis quirky small hotel is a calm oasis in miami beach it is on 5th street which is south of the sobe area and close to south pointe where there are nice restaurants and barsthe hotel is small and personal with a lovely bar and small courtyard area where you can sit and chillbut the best bit about this hotel is the staff so friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble we borrowed bikes and explored the area which was fun it is close to beach and even has sun beds available on the beach the hotel staff was what really set this place a part from others everyone from the lobby reception to cleaning staff were so nice and helpful the hotel is clean and in an excellent location the south of fifth area is beautiful and you can save by being able to walk to the beach south pointe park and many restaurants highly recommend the whole staff is very friendly the hotel ist in a very good condition and i`m sure that we will come back not good ist that the standard room is very small and the aircondition blows directly into the bedwhen we booked it said total price but then we were charged some extra resort fee of 1824 when we came to the check in unfair we were offered a free upgrade and we got a letter confirming thr upgrade but then we only got a regular room with no balcony and with a parking lot view the heating did not work and it was very cold all night on the other hand staff was polite free welcome drink was very good and the hotel is

            "Paragraph:    the hotel is about 25 minutes away from the airport its located very close to the beach the hotel staff is warm and friendly the rooms are fully equipped with a small kitchenette and a bar we were in the penthouse which had a private jacuzzi on rooftop the location of the hotel is such that you have plenty of options for food one can go out and explore overall excellent hotelfirst time staying at the z hotel and going back soon the room was very spacious and beautiful the location was perfect right on collins and ocean drive the view from our the balcony was spectacular we stayed two nights here at the start of a road trip around southern florida we thought that the location was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful being ihg members we were given a free drink on arrival and a complimentary bottle of wine to take to the room which was very nice the room itself was one of the penthouse suites with rooftop terrace and jacuzzi it had partial view of the sea but mainly other hotels and to be honest we didnt have enough time to really take advantage of this facility but it would be excellent for guests with more time to sparethe pool was closed a fact we werent made aware of before arriving however there was the use of a neighbouring hotel pool and to be fair we didnt have time anyway so not really an issue for us the breakfast was excellent and we were well placed for all of south beachthe only criticism we would have is that there were dirty cups and glasses outside of our room when we arrived and they were still there when we left two days later the general public areas could have done with updating and better cleaninglocated right on ocean drive however very brutal 60 concrete block most balconies completely obstructed from any ocean view or other views but for other concrete blocksservice is relatively poor for 4 stars categoryno pool  since october  although all pictures featuring poolno spa samenot your best shot at 4 stars hotel aroundon the positive side good location and nice beach areawe ended up getting a penthouse suite dont be scared  same price and we both got giddy as schoolgirls not only was the suite sweet but we were floored when we checked in and went out to our balcony there was a spiral staircase that went up to yet another bigger private balcony but this one had a not just a table not just a big private couch but our own private jacuzzi have we died and gone to puppy heaven nope just another cool amenity for the coolest hotel in south beach weve done a lot of the highend hotels but this is definitely trending on becoming our favoriteit was a beautiful room and the breakfasts were fantastic we elected to have the breakfast package included and were glad we chose that option the staff was extremely helpful  location was within walking distance to many suggested placesyes winter cruises time makes all hotel over prices but south beach is like that for any hotels so i wont talk about the price anymore the hotel is just amazing and one of my favorite of all ihg has i see a lot of them large room with everything you need ill go there again one day for surewe booked an ocean view room with the crowne plaza instead we got a city view with z ocean hotel after insisting we got a ocean view room for our last night the pool was closed due to construction but we could use the pool in another location however i am not going into the street in a bathrobe had we known about the construction we would definetly have chosen another hotel it frels like we have been cheated out of what could have been a great experience awful we arrived late friday and had to squeeze past 2 huge trash containers and ushered up some back entrance thru the back office to the reception no explanation given to this and i had to ask if there was any reason for maneuvering round trash containers and was told the hotel was going thru renovations  first impressions not good  we were offered a glass of sparkling wine in plastic dollar store glasses  an actual glass would have been nicer considering the so called standard of the hotel  we were told that our booking had breakfast for two but did not include our children  even though we were told it was included  she recommended that we did not orglder the buffet for them but order alcarte  proably just as well as there was no buffet offered  strange she did not know this we had booked the ocean view jacuzzi room and asked for the jacuzzi to be set up so our children could use it along with the pull out sofa to be made up  during this time the receptionist had not said please  good evening thank you we got to our room and went to see the jacuzzi that was being filled up and saw that it was filthy  two old used dirty towels were on one of the loungers  we went back to the reception and showed the pictures of the filthy jacuzzi and an extremely nice helpful gentleman began to help us and acknowledged our frustrations  we decided to go back to the room and sort the situation out in the morning  the kids pull out had been made with a sheet and light blanket and spent the night uncomfortable and freezing  we went back to the reception the next morning to sort the situation out  after a lot of back and fourth and no resolution we had the option to move to another room which we said we would not use the jacuzzi as the one we saw was filthy we were given an option at regular price for a room with no jacuzzi  the only room avalable at that time was an inside view of the pool but it had no water in it as it was been renovated what  for the price being charged i think we paid almost 500 for the night we now have no pool  i was told but other guests dont mind  we checked out that very minute  so much for our 6 day ocean view  if you really squint jacuzzi suite  we are platinum ihg members and i have never received see such run down conditions lack of customer services  we were not notified of any renovations and lack of facilities and how you can charge this ridiculous amount of money is beyond me  never againwe really enjoyed our stay the only reason we gave 4 not 5 stars is that we were not told in advance that the pool as well as the main entrance were both under renovations while i know this info would not have deterred me from staying it would have helped with activity planning and ease of access for my wife she recently hand foot surgery and navigating around the hotel would not have thrown us off your other saving grace is definitely your front desk agent extraordinaire jeannette as iam an platinum ambassador level member of their hotel program  ihg rewards and did not even have to mention that she greeted us as though we have stayed there before she is a star i believe you have an employee recognition program she should get the honor also the bellman juan at checkin and i forgot his name but the bellman upon checkout  nov 19th morning before 10am  he was so nice and accommodating we wanted to adopt him and take him on the cruise with ussmiles we truly felt like familyi will definitely returnthe other slight issue was the length of time it took to get our jacuzzi ready we were told 30 minutes but took more closer to 1 hr but once it was ready it was awesome we had the penthouse suite with jacuzzi which made the suite a duplex you go out to your balcony and up the winding stairs to the next floor and the space has a mini fridge jacuzzi and lounge area very worth havingthank you for starting our getaway off to a great startbooked roof top spa suite for thanksgiving weekend absolute nightmare no pool construction everywhere dirty room room had no view as advertised no advance notice of pool closure or construction this is holiday weekend folksjacuzzi was not ready did not properly log my rental auto in and subsequently do not have it on record 39 night for parking claimed i could not get me car because i did not have a ticket really piss poor customer service i lost it secutity became aggressive and i called police total nightmare i have traveled the world folks i am 56 years old this is the worst hotel experience that i have ever had please look at these reviews and keep looking my lawyer has actually advised me to sue them for charging me for the night i of course left on thanksgiving day and headed down to key largo i would never stay at this joint real story real problemsrooms are dated construction was annoying still charged daily resort fee without having a lobby or a pool was told because we have access to the ocean is why there is a resort fee  bs called for hot tub to be filled and never happened tv remotes didnt work properlywhen maintenance came they had another remote that worked for about an hour then same problems existed had turndown service on 1st day then not again for the next two nights not worth the price with so many other options right on the beach  especially for 500 bucks a night wouldnt pay more than 250 for this caliber accommodation very disappointing from the front desk service to the bar to the bottle of wine that they sent up as a gift  z ocean is first class my room was freshly refurbished and beautiful the location is outstanding i highly recommend z ocean hotelpros hotel is in an ideal location for walking to the beach and has beach towels chairs and umbrellas that come with your stay we were there for the seafood festival and the walking distance was perfect the restaurant downstairs is not associated with the hotel so you cant charge anything to the room but the breakfast is good and not expensive cons i mentioned the biting bugs in the room they asked me to send pictures so i did and never heard back the staff is not very informative or helpful eg no one bothered to mention how to use the card key to access the elevator so it takes a few minutes to figure it out because there is also no signage the signage to locate the pool area are difficult to decipher so it takes a few minutes to actually locate the pool area no one was there to provide a towel for the pool the pool is located in what appears to be an inner court yard and is cozy if im being politically correct had friends over for the festival asked if they could charge my room for parking front desk said yes parking attendants said no the room itself has a bathroom layout that was difficult for me to traverse eg there were buttons and dials with no signage so you did not know what was going to happen when you turned or pressedwasnt sure exactly what to expect as i hadnt ever visited or heard of this property linda at reception was outstanding she hooked us up with a beautiful room and highlighted the various amenities the room was exceptional in size quality and layout essentially it was a large studio suite with a jack and jill style bathroom 2 sinks and fabulous rainfall shower all the staff we interacted with treated us like friends and went out of their way to make us feel welcome the location is top notch just across the street from the boardwalk and beach the pool was closed but we were allowed to use one next door free of charge they also provided complimentary beach chairtowelumbrella service again more than i expected hoping that we will be able to return to zocean do not book the penthouse suite with the expectation of a pristine patio the rooftop walls were stained and rust covered smelled like sewer and the privacy curtains were tattered and inoperable the wet bar refrigerator was dilapidated the fancy bose stereo system in the room and on the rooftop only had an auxiliary cord its 2019 please upgrade to devices that are iphonebluetooth compatible dont waste your 600night on this place this hotel is great for people of all ages it has great wifi and great service in the waiting area it has a gigantic chessboard and other great games like that the position is great lots of nice restaurants and bars i highly recommend this fabulous hotelwe were at the z ocean 5 years ago but it has declined since then on the plus side the location is excellent just off of ocean drive and the beach the suites there are many of them are set up like a small apartment they come with a small fridge espresso machine sink and assorted glassware and dishes there are also two tvs one in the small living area and one in the bedroom the large bathroom is separate from the shower room which also has a sink the bedroom area had a very comfortable king bed and good storagecloset space the problems involve the rooms outside deck and private upper deck reached by a spiral staircase that has a large private whirlpool tub the walls of the deck area need work many of the furnishings and outside bar entertainment units are worn or rusting and the tile floors look grungy also the hotels hall carpeting looks dirty other issues are the lack of hotel amenities while there is a very small gym and a small pool the only other public space other than the lobby is a covered outside area with a bar that always seems to be empty the bar is located off the lobby next to a restaurant called the front porch open for bl and d although we were disappointed in the restaurant 5 years ago we tried it again  still not good fortunately there are many good restaurants nearby parts of the hotel have been turned into condo units and this might have something to do with the lack of attention being given to the hotel rooms all that said the hotel staff couldnt be nicer or more accommodatingask if the pool is open yet when you book at 200250 a night this hotel is fine  400 there are much better options the rooms are updated and you can tell they are trying to make it a better place the hallways are outdated and the carpet looks pretty gross the front desk staff is friendly and helpful i am not sure how to describe the gym other than to say they should just remove it and send guests elsewhere it is pathetic also there was water leaking from the roof of the walkway to the bar and restaurantnot a good look great stay great rooms great staff 1010 the hotel was in a great location and had an amazing view of the city and beach loved our stay oh so much i would definitely come back and was celebrating an anniversary and this stay made it that much specialwhat a lovely room and hotel walking distance to espanola way the art deco district and the beach i enjoyed our stay and time in the rooftop jacuzzi the beds were very comfortable that shower is everything the water pressure and setup of the bathroom allowed for privacy for two people to get dressed and ready for a night outi had a problem when i had to cancel my room for work the front office manager sonja armstrongbryan offered me another room for another stay without a fee i agreed all was great until i actually tried to book another room she ignored several emails it wasnt like i wasnt flexible with days months after being ignored for seven days i realized i dont ever want to go to this hotel i work three jobs two with the public and this is no way to solve a problem or treat another human being either the hotel is mismanaged or they just dont care about their guests either way i would never stay at another ihg hotel we moved into a hotel owned condo from a private owned condo partway through our stay and the difference in standards and service was astounding the condo was very clean and comfortable with nice extra touches the staff were hugely helpful even offering to move our luggage from one room to theirs its in a very very good location for the beach art deco buildings and very good restaurants as well as supermarkets within a few minutes walk as their swimming pool has been closed by the owners they have an arrangement with the betsy next door and even provide towels they also have a private area of the beach with towels and sunbeds provided which is a nice touch room service can be hard to get hold of but when it arrives its good the staff though are one of the best things the people on reception and the cleaner we met were so lovely it totally turned our trip around after a truly horrendous initial stay with the private owners i would stay here again but book direct with the hotel do not book a private condoi booked my stay at this hotel specifically because of the bathroom beach and pool when i was showering  i moved the top left nozzle shower head to aim towards me as i did with the rest of them that nozzle fell off and hit my foot which was painful i picked it up and placed it back into the wall although that should have never happened at all as i stood in there attempting to enjoy my shower it became flooded due to the drainage working improperly this caused me to end my shower shortly after it was an extreme disappointment not only that but the pool wasnt even available for use when i booked the room it did not state anywhere that the pool was not available even though the pool was available for my use next door its unacceptable i wanted to use the pool at the z hotel not the neighboring hotel again the pool is partly why i booked my stay there that being said i am not satisfied with my stay i will rate it a 1 note the check in experience was absolutely horriblenever been to miami and wife was joining on a biz trip wanted to be close to biz but enjoy ammenities property was clean quiet excellent food great service location was perfect ckose to oceann restaurants i would stay there again price was fair pool was out of service but had a nice alternativethis hotel was exceptional the staff were excellent so friendly and helpful the valet lewis was extremely helpful in keeping our luggage so we could take a trolley around town and even had a taxi waiting on us to take us to our cruiseship after our tour the room was greatso comfortable and modern its location was excellent right where all the restaurants and activity was taking place we ate in the restaurant on site the front porch and the food was delicious a very busy bar was semioutside covered so you could see the people walking up and down the street we enjoyed our short stay immenselythe zocean is beautiful the first night was very underwhelming at check in they put us in a regular room when we had reserved and confirmed the zocean view suite they said they didnt have another one available then they couldnt get the jacuzzi for our room running lots of mix ups and lack of communication the next day they got us in the correct room and gave us a free night other than poor communication the service was good and friendly they initial told me they would give me a few free nights if they were to make good on that promise which they havent yet i would absolutely give them my business again and make a full trip out of it although it was a terrible first night the hotel is beautiful and the staff was above average its pricey but you get what you pay for the bell hop loved his job and was amazing in switching us to the correct room the next day if not for the big mix up this place would get a top notch rating from me cannot beat the location or the privacy and amenities on the rooftop terraces for those who have a penthouse but the place needs some tlc little things like lights or phones not working the awnings on the rooftops do not work and all need replacing it is really a condo not a hotel even the front porch cafe the only onsite restaurant is separately owned and managed we could never get in there for breakfast we stayed in a jacuzzi room which was very nice room is spacious shower is amazing and the king size was even better so comfortable slept like a baby they have curtains to give privacy in jacuzzi if you want also south beach can be noisy when you close the patio sliding glass door you hear nothing pool is very nice and cleaneveryone has been very nice and helpfuli have stayed at z ocean many years in a row the place was always beautiful the location could not be better the service was impeccable wellthings have drastically changed because i am an ihg member and a repeat customer i have gotten to know many employees and they have gotten to know or recognize me there were pluses with this stay on arrival i was sent a beautiful bottle of champagne a very nice surprise i booked two rooms for three nights each i was able to get the rooms i requested one of which was even a complimentary early check in breakfast at the front porch cafe was excellant as always the beach staff as always were pleasant and personable unfortunately the water was really rough and needed to spend time at the pool as swimmung was pretty unsafe due to rip tides that happens let me start by saying i did have issues with my original reservations after over 90 minutes on the phone w reservations i just cancelled and rebooked my stay i also found it odd a bellman answered one of my calls were they that short staffed wellunderstatement the rooms are still gorgeous and the location remains optimal however service has changed really changed let me explain what we noticed the bellman who used to meet you at the curb was not there thentootries in the rooms werenot replenishsed many of the pool chairs were torn the hot tub did not work and rarely was filled the pool deck always looked like it needed a sweep there was garbage in the hot tub and the pool could have used a skimevery day typically there is a pool bar and attendant the attendant makes rounds gets drinks and food wellday 1 no attenedant day two attendant took 45 minutes for two cocktails that were horrible sent back because they were so badyet no comp drinks and still charged despite our concerns we then got our own drinks it was right down the stairs it was faster we knew the drinks would be right its just too bad they could have made a lot more money if they were more on top of it no pool towels had to ask for them every day in fact i picked up dirty dishes and empty cups poolside that had been there since the day before called down stairs and had them picked up i also pulled old towels from the day before off chairs too okroom tidy i asked three times to have the sleeper sofa made up in one room on the way to dinnner on the first night request number 4 pleaae make up roll away no worriesi called after dinner when i got back as well so after 6 requestsit was made up the next day when we left for breakfast and shopping we put the make up thenroom sign on well not done back mid afternoonsign still onroom still not made up so when we left we asked we were assured it wpuld be made up it was at 11 pm a knock on the doorthe towels we requestedexcept we didnt our friends did they had no tpwelsmin the room called at 1015 when we fot back for towels we sentnthem to that room wait 45 minutes for towels the towels should have been there when the room was made up this became a daily experience there was always a line at the desk which used to be staffed with two peoplebut now only staffed with one the regualr housekeepers i knew were no where around some of my makeup was missing this was a first i was disappointed such a great hotel whos service is now in the toilet i spoke with the manager thenmanager was understanding and kind was not aware of some issues and aware of others apology acceptedhowever we spent a significant amount of money to stay thereand the service was that of a budget hotel in sobe hotels are a dime a dozen and for this money you could stay at any number of places as an ihg member i expect a certain level of service it is no longer no more free water daily no more cleaning up the balcony staff is so slim includung the front desk i feel sad because i loved staying here im not sure ill be back next year loved this hotel friendly staff made checkin easy and pleasurable as an ihg member we were offered free refreshments and settled for a free bottle of wine had an oceanview suite that was bright and cheery sophisticated furnishings with a nespresso machine wife loved it microwave and all necessary kitchen amenities two tvs in the room and an amazing shower with 6 water streams coming at you two separate sinks available which makes it easier for the wife and i the kingsize bed provided a wonderful nights rest if you can request the penthouse floor on this floor the outside balcony leads to a spiral staircase that puts you rooftop with your own private 4person hot tub the location makes it easy to get to the beach also would highly recommend this hotel for a wonderful stay in miami beachthis was the first time my husband and i stayed at this hotel wonderful stay our room was clean and smelled fresh the employees were very informative upon arrival we have stayed at a few different hotels on ocean drive and we will return to z ocean in the futurewe stayed in april 2019good pointsspire recognition upgrade and another treat givenhigh floor rooms have terrace and roof hotub up a spiral staircasenice suitesgood location near south beachfriendly helpful staffareas for improvementinclude breakfast for spire members most crowne plazas do this these dayssadly our hot tub was not working and we spent a few hours waiting around while they tried to fix fuse motor etc having been told it was filled and ready to go i hope when we come back we dont have this issueall in all a good stay great hotel we look forward to return if they can fix the hot tubi was recommended this hotel by friends the location and room was everything checkin was very thorough and professionali would suggest a deep cleaning and dusting of the public areas move the furniture sweep under the tables deep clean cushions i noticed that most guests sit on them in bikinis bathing suits or very thin or netted beach cover upsthis is very unsanitary if they are not disinfected or cleaned regularly this is something to seriously consider as it is a very high traffic lobby and patio area the rooms just need some touch up painting of walls frames and doors in certain areasotherwise i would definitely return i loved my roomif you only want location its perfect but expensive over the weekend and thats where it stops my problem started with a phone call to the reservation line  spanish versus scottish it was never going to work the trainee at reception was fantastic but theres where it ends we went to our room which wasnt the room that i booked came out for dinner to meet a party in one room down the corridor and a screaming argument in another complained to the manager and the man couldnt even be civil to me or look me in the eye i then discovered at our next sop the next night id left my pyjamas there 2 emails with no reply and then an international phone call to find out theres nothing in there log i know thats where i left them i contacted ihg and got result at all this is the worst hotel and value in miamithis is a hidden gem on south beach we were pleasantly surprised with the size of the rooms which had all the amenities  and most importantly the beds and pillows were superb we had a corner room overlooking collins ave which can be noisy but once the balcony was closed it was fine we didnt eat in the restaurant but it must be good because it was always busyweekend getaway penthouse floor nice rooms  patio deck  rooftop with hot tube  2 entrance to bathroom right on southbeach miami right on ocean drive  short walk to everything  restaurant in building pool tables on 1st floor should have been a relaxing 48 hours under an electric canopy shading a 600 sq ft sun terrace but the hotel failed to advise that the electric canopies were broken which made use of the terrace impossible without risk of severe sunburn the hotel have yet to comment on their failure to advise guests booking these suites that the sun shades were broken and look at these pictures in addition the quality of the terraces in particular and my room was a million miles from how they are advertised on the website grossly misrepresented the hotel failed to respond to three emails the general manager is as yet unresponsive but they ruined my weekend in south beach avoid from our initial welcome to the manager thanking us for our visit the team at z ocean hotel could not have been more professional or helpful everyone from our check in host housekeeping concierge beach hosts etc was friendly and wanted our visit to be perfect if you decide to stay i would try to book a penthouse suite the view room layout and private rooftop hot tubsitting area overlooking ocean drive with views of the actual ocean really took our visit to the next level i will note they need a little tlc not major still beautiful  very clean  kudos to the housekeeping teamthe location of the hotel is perfect walking distance to everything you could wantneed  yet far enough you dont hear the all night party goers an added bonus the hotels front porch restaurant is noted as one of the top brunch stops in the areawe would recommend the z ocean  primarily for the team representing the crowne brand great jobloved the rooms and location i prefer the retro vibe in south beach which is prevalent this place is well located and the rooms are large an comfortable an easy walk to the beach and local dining definitely one of the top three hotels weve stayed awesome location just steps away from the ocean beach with great restaurants surrounding the area great customer service friendly and professional the suite was very clean updated  bright and open floor plan would definitely recommend this location and wouldnt stay at any other hotel when visiting south beach miami this crowne plaza definitely a 5 star  visit booked the pool access suite arrived at hotel apparently they didnt have that room left even although our ihg confirmed the booking for that room they said the hotel doesnt always follow proper rules by trying to contact us they said they had upgraded the room to one with a jacuzzi so ok accepted except the balcony was a mess beds were broken was cigarette butts all over the place it was filthy first night we called for the jacuzzi to be made up we checked out two days later and the filthy water was still left in it no one came to empty it or clean it the breakfast was in a restaurant attached but separate all the sell is eggs done in any way you can imagine but eggs is about it oh or pancakes no good for someone who cant have eggs even that was terrible manager arguing with a waitress in front of everyone hotel foyer was the only decent part of this hotel would never ever stay here again and will be submitting a complaint to ihg  bravo z ocean  and 12i was greeted by melissa at the front desk and she discussed points earned from ihg the room was spacious had everything that you would need and more melissa went out of her way to make sure i had everything i needed including virtual assistant text checking in on my accommodations the staff was amazing not to mention you can get service from the front porch poolside this day included beach chairs and champagne upon arrival the only reason why i didnt five stars was because of the condition of the building there are some obvious where is a tear they could just use a fresh coat of paint or plaster small things that should be tended to outside of that i cant wait to stay again thank you to the ocean staff ive had my eyes on this hotel for years so i was really excited to finally get an opportunity to stay here i was here less than 24 hours because i was overnighting in miami beach before continuing onto brazil its a boutique hotel with only about 79 rooms which are all suites my room was beautifully appointed and even had a wet bar with bar stools there was an entertainment tower with flat screen tvs on both sides one facing the bed and the other facing the living area ive never seen a bathroom area so spacious id call it a bathroom suite it has three parts that can be closed off by frosted glass panels a separate vanity toilet another vanity outside of the shower the shower had four fixed sprays an overhead rain showerhead a removable showerhead and a builtin bench the shower was a wonderfulrelaxing experience id definitely stay here again be sure to inquire about the daily incidental charge to be frozen on your credit card and any other charges so that youll be prepared the location is just a few blocks from the lincoln road pedestrian mall in south beach thanks kate for your assistancei had the occasion to stay st this hotel 2 times april  may the service from matt  anwar was outstanding in april when my wife and i checked in so i thought it wasonly fitting to go back in may when going through jfk the rooms on both occasions were immaculate and the hotel staff in the lobbby bar and restaurant catered to your stay to genuinely make you feel comfortable thank you matt and anwarlocated one block off the ocean near the large park great location front desk has been confused both times i checked in make sure you have your reservation confirmation number rooms are very nicewe arrived at the z ocean hotel early in the day and were allowed to check in and access the room immediately everyone we interacted with were very friendly courteous and helpful the room was perfect very well appointed great location will definitely stay here againso nice and amazing hotel good location also worked with me with a misunderstanding ill be back soon i would stay here again in a heartbeat if youre going to south beach you want to stay here also very clean just a 10 out of 10 overall thank you againi would like to say my stay was wonderful service was great the room was beautiful they had everything in the hotel basically i wouldnt even have to leave the hotel for no reason overall i will stay again highly recommend this hotel the hotel itself is very easy to navigate it is one of the first hotels at the start of ocean drive so its got easy beach access and its not in the middle of crazy the room was beautiful we had a balcony that overlooked collins a very comfortable bed nice little kitchen with great nespresso coffee drinks and snacks to purchase and a full bathroom and a half bathroom the bed was very comfortable the there was plenty of storage the traffic noise was fine it was quiet at night and the drapes did a good job of keeping the morning light out the pool was not available so we had access to the pool at the betsy next door the complimentary beach chairs umbrellas and towels was great feature and the front porch restaurant cannot be beat the best place for breakfast all day and everything you could imagine i loved our stay would definitely return room 318 was greatgood but not great experience rooms are not cheap but furniture needs updating view on a lot of land was not very good when i asked for a better view they did not really care location is great and hot tub on a balcony is a great featurevery disappointed by this property ill start with the good  it is a block from the beach near many restaurants in miami beach and the room was clean not much else good though our toilet didnt work right there was no hot water very loud noises coming from the vents throughout the night the elevator didnt work and the pool area was left dirty for example there was trash and cigarette butts on a table outside our room when we arrived that were still there when we left  overall it feels like it was a nice place 10 years ago but no effort has been made to keep it up to standardi have not been in miami for several years and came back to the zocean which we always loved a hidden gem on south beach which is very professionally runthe staff is welcoming and friendly and the rooms are great with an outdoor jacuzzieven the minibar has everything you need and the towels are perfectgreat start of a stay and looking forward to morethis is a all suite hotel with a excellent location in south beach the suites are very spacious and well equipped the staff is very friendly and helpful the bedding is very comfortable the bathroom is very large bath robes are provided the beach club is available with loungers and umbrellas on the beach our suite did not have a ocean viewbut had a huge balcony with a private hot tub there are plenty of excellent restaurants and bars within walking distance of the hotel we were able to use ihg points to pay for the suitethis is a crowne plaza hotel highly recommended \n",

            "Paragraph:    we stayed at this place from 12th to 17th december 2016 after seeing photos online and reading overall positive reviewsits not really a hotel but more of a bed and breakfast although breakfast choice is very very limited not even having cereals available there is not an actual dining room but a small lobby converted to use for breakfast each morningfirst time around the entrance to the hotel can be hard to find too even uber was struggling as it took the car to the adjacent side street dont think about parking here as it is all chargeable 247 we cancelled our car and stuck with uber for the tripstaff were all without exception very friendly and helpful especially maria the room we had 106 was a very spacious room indeed even with four of us sharing there are sufficient facilities but less than what you expect at a hotellocation is good close to shops and beach although as expensive area to stay in wifi coverage is good and it was not too noisy for useating around the corner on ocean drive is very expensive there is a mall nearby but if you go to dolphin mall about 25 minutes by car there are many more shops and a food courtthere are a number of hop on hop off bus services and they may seem like a good deal but consider what you really want to see as the round route can take up quite a bit of time and it may just be cheaper to use the local bus service or uber there is also a free tram service looping around the area which goes near the local mall toofor a cheap haircut or hair styling there is the american beauty school at about 510 minutes walk with students who can do you hair at a fraction of the normal costs as they are studentscheck out is 11am so there is plenty of time to get yourself sorted in the morning the accommodation is all on the first floor above shops and there is a small lift mainly for luggage usewhether your staying one night or one week give this place a try we flew in for a cruise a day early and stayed here the staff was friendly and extremely accommodating the room and common areas were very clean right on collins ave one block from ocean drive we had a great stay and wish this place much success keep up the good workthe hotel is actually a secret pearl as it is described dont be confused by the door on collins ave the hotel is upstairs the rooms are georgeous very large very comfortable very quiet maybe a desk would be welcomed the people are very kind and very helpful they do really care for you dont seem to be just a job but a true passion we loved the stay and hope to have the chance to come back first choice for south beachbased on good reviews we have chosen this hotel on our post cruise stay in miami beach the hotel is ideally located in the south beach literally few steps away from infamous ocean drive and the beach the rooms were spacious and clean the staff very helpful especially maria at the gront desk who was giving us good tips what to do and see in miami we would definitely chose againvery pleasant stay dont be put off by the rather indistinct entrance or should i say door once inside it is very welcoming with a lot of nice touches eg free glass of champagne social hour with free wine and nibbles which allows you to mix with other guests in an informal atmosphere location is great right in the heart of the art deco center and one street back from the beachwould certainly return for short stayeverything was amazing very good location very big and comfortable rooms actually we had included as bonus a wine tasting each day between 67 pm it is very close to lincoln mall road 20 min walking its good that is very close to the beach 3 min walking and also not really in the crowded area of ocean drive although the breakfast could be improved we chose this hotel following excellent reviews on trip advisor we were also wary of entrance but once inside everything was as expectedwe have stayed in more expensive hotels where the bathroom was not as nice as ithacathe staff are very friendly and helpful with 5  service from brian well donethe ithaca is on the south end of miami beach just a block off the main drag and the sea despite being in the heart of the action and there is a lot of actioncrowds cars the hotel is remarkably quiet small but friendly staff as others have mentioned the hotel can at first be hard to find on the street theres no marquee just a sign on a regularsized glass door this is a great contrast to most other hotels in the area which grab you by their exteriors the ithaca has fewer amenities than many hotels like a concierge bell hops etc its the kind of place you should go if youre comfortable taking care of your own needs the rooms are large and clean and brightkind of ikeaish theres a nice continental breakfast breads and bagels yogurt cold cuts we understand theres a wine hour in the evening but we were never there to try it we give the ithaca four stars not five for three reasons 1 the mattress sagged 2 the wifi was a bit inconsistent and 3 the bedside lamps were of an odd glass that cast a prismlike light making reading difficultwe arrived late for our quick 1night stay here the front desk person was so friendly and we had a room with two doubles since we had our 10year old son with us the room was awesome and so comfortable while theres barely a view the hotel is located just around the corner from the south beach scene and its a great location to walk to a ton of shopsrestaurantsthe beach would definitely stay there again super clean great service and a good continental breakfast too charming placemy girlfriend and i had the pleasure to spend one night in ithaca hotel and we couldnt have expected any better from any point of view the room was really welcoming brand new and stylish furnitures perfectly clean and spaciousthe location just in the heart of south beach close to the best restaurants shops bars and the beachbut what made this experience really exceptional was the service received from the staff a special thanks for lily maria and agatha basically our luggage didnt make it to miami airport upon our arrival and we were panicking as we had to leave for a cruise just the next day and they spent the whole day and night on the phone with the terrible customer service of british airways trying to track down the luggage for usthis was not requested and totally out of their interest but they literally didnt have peace until they managed to get it sortedthank you again and see you soonpaolo  barbiithaca is on collins avenue basically the street parallel to ocean drive the hotel faces all the stores on collins avenue its sort of hidden as the entrance is small with a stair case leading to the hotel floor its basically more like holiday apartments but run as a boutique hotel the rooms are massive well from what i know all are as ours was enormous even with a lounge set on the other end of the room shower and room facilities was excellent the hotel also has its own 24hr parking basically a valet but there is a massive parking lot just across the road which is reasonably priced of course the best way to get around miamiflorida is with a car so parking facilities could be thought of as mandatory the hotel does not have a restaurant but does offer a small compliment breakfast in common areas just behind the hotel is ocean drive with an abundance of eateries so finding a good place to eat with a view is easy if your spending the day on south beach then i would recommend taking the hotel provided umbrellabeach chairs free but its on first come first serve so get up early and reserve yours we stayed over in december between xmas and new year rates where high but i think that is more based on the location rather than seasonithaca is a great little hotel 1 block off the main strip which was very central and unexpectedly quiet check in was friendly fast and simple with a glass of champagne as a lovely treat our room was huge tastefully decorated and immaculate quality toiletries and bath robes were a nice touchthe continental breakfast was basic but was all we needed to start our daythe provision of deck chairs and towels for our days on the beach were very much appreciated all in all ithaca is a little gem of a hotel good value for money with helpful friendly staff and highly recommended for a stay on south beach i searched the internet for just the right hotel to finish our amazing three week holiday this hotel was perfect very close to the beach large rooms fantastic service from the manager when you first arrive it doesnt look much from the outside but inside is great beds are the comfiest of any hotels ive stayed in memory foam we had room number 102 and 109 both lovely rooms 102 was our favourite however two things firstly the ac unit is really noisy we switched it off at night to sleep and secondly the traffic noise is loud especially on a saturday night we wanted to be close to the action so no complaints here just for information 109 is a quieter room beautifully decorated would certainly return pilkington familylike other reviewers have mentioned the hotel does have an awkward entrance as you must walk up stairs and put your luggage in the elevator separately however once you get to your room it is totally cute rooms were clean water bottles provided free snacks coffee and water always available in walking distance from ocean drive which includes the beach and fantastic restaurants hotel staff very accommodating and device oriented the one thing i would say is request a room towards the end of the hallway and not close to the checkin desk since the hotel is so small if you want some privacy ask to be at the end of the hallway opposite the check in we would definitely recommend this hotel warm welcome excellent room with lots of facilities very comfortable bed breakfast a bit chaotic as items not replenished quickly but good choice wine and cheese hour good fun especially as wine so expensive in miami thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend highlynot hotels fault but really annoys that quoted price then has city tax 4 dade tax 3 nightly resort tax 15 state tax 7 all added on adding over 20 to offered price its about time us sorted their quoted prices out as in europe sales and other taxes should be included in the quoted price not added on like some big con as appears nowwhat a beautiful hotel finished to a very high standard absolutely spotless our room was a great size and so clean all modern accessories the staff were so helpful and polite the beach is literally a 3 minute walk away and the staff will give you a beach bag beach towels chairs and umbrellas to take with you each evening there is a social hour with complimentary wine and snacks breakfast is good simple cheese pastries etc but good enough there is always water coffee and fruit available to you the hotel is situated on collins ave a great place full of high end shops dash armani tommy hilfiger etc the art deco district is beautiful so great to see all the lovely architecture i stayed there last january it was really a perfect choice i loved it location privacy very warm atmosphere fine staff the concierge who welcomed me was so helpful comfortable room id definitely go back next timemy wife and i booked this hotel as a precruise stop over and were not disappointed we try to avoid the chain hotels and looked at tripadvisor for a nice boutique hotel and ithaca seemed to check all the boxes mild anxieties after our shuttle driver informed us that he had never heard of the place were soon replaced by nervous anticipation once we arrived at the small awning over the outside door a steep flight of stairs led to a pristine lobby and a friendly welcome from staff but the best was yet to come our room wasnt quite ready and when we came back a few hours later to our cleaned room we we stunned wow what a beautiful space large quirky clean stylish what else can i say just stunning anyway if youre on the fence about booking here dont hesitate you cant beat it for valuethis is a beautiful small 11 rooms european style hotel i received a glass of champagne after checking in our room was lovely and spacious breakfast was lovely continental with a variety of breads meats and cheeses great coffee the best thing was this i had left all of my jewelry in my room and left for a cruise i contacted the hotel they had it all and sent it back to me whats better is that they sent it before i could pay them for the postage talk about the honor system if i ever return to miami beach this will be my go to place what a gemone note there is an elevator but for luggage only i wouldnt recommend this hotel for folks who have trouble climbing stairs we had an spare night due to a flight connection in the way back from our holidays and we took advantage of a very good online offer and booked ithaca they gave us the last room of the corridor we had to dodge the cleaning service tools to enter the room was fine small but good bathroom and comfy bed all very kitsch the rest of the hotel was a bit dark and claustrophobic and the place where they serve the breakfast in fact the lobby with just two foldable tables was ridiculously tiny in fact they have trays in case you want to take it to your room on the other hand the breakfast itself was completely dispensable no appealing at all finally i read here people complaining about the service in our case it depended on the people the one who charged us was quite curt but the others were very nice and helpful the overall experience was ok as long as we took advantage of a significant discount otherwise i would not pay the regular price to stay hereall the staff were very warmth receptive thanks for everything the location is amazing in the really hot spot for miami south beach and they also provided umbrella chairs  towels when going to the beacha block from the south beach strip free champagne very clean staff is excellent and very friendly  no hassle easy check in and the employees are just as beautiful as the hotel home away from homewe had a lovely stay at the ithaca you might not notice it walking past but inside is a beautiful boutique hotel they rooms are spacious and beautifully finished the staff are super friendly and the location is as close to south beach as you would want to be without staying on the very busy strip we will definitely be back on our next visitlittle bit late with this review we had a really nice stay at this hotel for 3 nights pre cruiseit was our first time in miami and we enjoyed it very muchthe hotel is in a great position near to the shops beach restaurants transport etcour room 108 was the queen room and although not as large as the other rooms it fulfilled all our needs and was exactly as described on the website good comfortable bed linens pillows bathroom towels bathrobes amenities etc lots of nice little extra touches in the room it was very clean but like a couple of other reviewers on the second day we returned mid afternoon for a rest and the room had not been serviced it might be a good idea to inform the office if you are not going to be out all day to avoid this we elected just to take some clean towels etc as they could not start the clean for another 40 minutesreally nice continental breakfast with good fresh produce on offer and we especially enjoyed the yoghurtssadly the breakfast area is very small only 2 tables and unfortunately our smaller room had no facilities to enable us to take the breakfast to the room as some other clients could however we were lucky to get seats each dayhappy hour in the afternoon was another nice touch with wine juice cheese and fruit being offered in the lobbybrian and marie were very friendly and helpful and made you feel very much at homehotel does not have a passenger lift but does have a service lift for your luggagewifi was excellentwould stay in this hotel again if we were to plan another visit to miamifinal note  dont forget to return your room key card at the end of your stay or you may get chargedwe stayed for 4 nights the hotel was just as i expected the photos are spot on the rooms are modern and clean and wellproportioned i think they said that they are only 11 rooms so its fairly quiet and the staff were excellent they gave good advice when i asked about things to do and they were very friendly breakfast was very good they were constantly replenishing the food unfortunately there are only 2 tables so one morning we just ate in our room which was also fine we had 2 complimentary glasses of fizz and i love that they offer free wine and nibbles in the evening not many people took part in this during our stay but it was a thoughtful sociable touch which you dont find in many places great location just one block from south beach highly recommend itits in the upstairs of an old bank building and decorated to match the art deco style of south beach very convenient to the beach and the restaurants and shops parking provided in a nearby garage wonderfully comfortable bedexcellent gem in south beach clean and quaint damn i wish i had pics trust me when i say the professional pics look exactly the way rooms look in real life spacious clean v pretty and new id go back in a heart beat nice hotel right in the middle of shopping restaurants bars and the beach ocean drive just 4 min walk nice and very friendly hotel very good service encellent rooms nice breakfast we recommend it highly we loved this place its a couple blocks from beach it will be our first choice the next time were in sobe the rooms are new each one is unique in design and shape this corner property was once the first national bank of miami so its really a cool place to stay staff is terrific and will gladly hold your luggage while you hit the beach beach chairs and umbrellas are provided free of charge breakfast and coffee are complimentary as well please do not be alarmed that the hotel lobby is actually on the second floor the street level entrance has one flight of stairs on left and a baggage elevator on right this could be offputting to some but it really is a nice feature since no one loiters in front of the hotel as they do in other sobe spots you can sleep safe travels all this hotel is situated one block off of ocean drive  good location aside from that it is mediocre at best we had the worst room  108  where there was a constant generator like noise all through the night i stayed here with mom and we did not sleep well at all the hotel is on a second floor with about 20 steps to walk up my mom being 80 years of age found it difficult their small elevator is only good for luggage the manager assem was the only good thing about this hotel he was proactive and helpful continental breakfast is included the coffee was awful as they serve instant coffee it wouldnt cost much to get a proper coffee machine ithaca has a great location in south beach miami the rooms are spacious and the beds are big and comfy even though its not on the beach they have sunchairs and beachtowels for their guests a nice bonus was the happy hour in the lobby where they served wine fruit cheese and crackers for free friendly staff breakfast ordinary but for me it doesnt matter i dont need a breakfast buffet every morningcan def recommend this hoteli booked at ithaca sb based on proximity to the beach and was all around pleased the staff was so charming as was the champagne upon arrival the room was cute and clean i would most certainly stay here againwe stayed here before boarding a cruise we have stayed on collins street before and like the area we were disappointed with the location and the staff seems like it is not run very very well and lacked in customer service on the first day we got up and while my husband was in the shower the water went off we were not told about the water being shut off and the other 3 of us could not take showers when we went to check out we asked for an adjustment because we didnt have water for the day and we were told they would not do anything because they had been having water problems for the last 2 weeks and they were happy to have it fixed they said we were lucky to have water for the last day and it had costed them so much money they could not adjust the price for 250 a night i did expect to have water or at least be accommodated the hotel was clean and the rooms are big i would say with all the great hotels on collins street try another one location is great somewhat difficult to find standard is okay but lacking a good wifi was without wifi most of the time and coming from abroad the wifi connection means a lot great restaurants around the corner and lovely personal recommendwhat a gembeautiful placegorgeous room super spacious stayed thanksgiving week staff super friendly and nothing too much troubleif you want ice just ask and they will get it for youwe have stayed in many us hotels and this one was one of the bestshort walk to the beach and ocean drivethey have beach towels chairs and sun brollies you can useslept well on comfy beds and the breakfast was very tastyreally enjoyed our stay thank you aimee and paola you made our stay super specialxvery pretty intimate hotel at first i thought it was a bit small from the outside but the room was amazing the staff was very polite and on hand at any time they provided a cocktail hour as well as breakfast lets not to mention the location right around the corner from the beach but far enough not to be disturbed at night by the noise i will go back again dont miss out staff was accommodating hotel was clean free wine and cheese in the dvening was nice place is in a good location with only a short walk to the beach and various restaurants but the hotel overall is datedthe water our entire stay was lukewarm at best so showers were miserable they said it was just our room but every guest said the same  and it never got fixed they stock the rooms with ice buckets but theres no ice machines at all go figure our room looked out at an alley and apartment building its loud at night with partiers and traffic on collins ave they serve a continental breakfast which was good in a tiny dark anteroom staff was pleasant enough we wont be returning to this hotelgreat little find really modern and contemporary very good value for money with continental breakfast right near the beach bars and restaurants room was a great size as there was 2 couples sharing bathroom great with bath robes and slippers very memorable and right on the water in a very walkable neighborhood but i must also give out a couple warnings this place is not ada friendly with a steep staircase you have to climb to reach the front desk they might let you use the luggage elevator we liked the breakfast and had a nice large room service was friendly and genuinely nice one more warning the front door of the hotel was locked when we got there we went next door to a souvenier shop and they got us inside good casual crab restaurant a short walk away great welcome with a free glass of champagne huge room interesting furnishings comfortable bedthe location towards the bottom of south beach is great also they offered free wine and cheese at 6pmthe modest breakfast is served in the minimalist lobby  bit of a squash if more than a handful of guests arrive at the same timehowever there was quite a bit of noise at night the pillows were poor quality and hard and the shower head was ineffective the base price is good but after tax and the resort fee it bumped it up substantially  i would rather they did not bother with the extras and used resort fee to sort out the issuesi was skeptical when we first arrived but it was a great experience this is not a full service hotel so dont try to arrive when the staff has gone home but it is a boutique abode in an outstanding location if you want to be able to walk around south beach something we did for two days in a row easy access to the beach and pier walkable to the many many fabulous restaurants on espanola way the complimentary breakfast was good if not very good the wine and cheese in the afternoon the same the room was very large the bed comfortable the staff unobtrusive im sure some would not be happy with this but i hate big hotels if you want a big hotel dont come hereif you want to see what south beach is like this is a great base to do it from we didnt have a car and only used our feet to get aroundthe staff member who looked after us on a late arrival without reservation was fantastic nothing too hardgreat room with comfy bed very good linen and fantastic bathroom the price on the surface is pretty good at 75 a night but when you add in the taxes the final cost was 111 huh i get the government taxes but a 25 resort fee this is not a resort but a tiny boutique hotel in an old art deco building maybe its just a miami thing i dont understandstayed at the hotel just for one night in august 2017 and it was great wish i had stayed longer excellent location one block from the beach very beautiful rooms the staff was super nice would it recommend it without a doubti booked 2 hotel rooms before our cruise in march 2018 i booked directly with this hotel over the phone back in july and confirmed with them their cancellation policy the other couple we were traveling with need to cancel i have been attempting to keep one of the rooms and cancel the other one for the past 10 days now when i called on 1013 i was told only a manager could complete the request and id see a confirmation email and refund in a couple of days never happened so on 1017 i tried to contact them via their website where you submit a question i never heard anything now today i call no answer phone just rings and rings and rings then turns into a busy signal im very concerned this hotel is so hidden you might pass it while looking for it it doesnt look like much from the outside and it appears to be a bit small you will be pleasantly surprised when you go to your room i love the beachy decorated rooms and it offers plenty of space the fixtures are modern and i found the room to be very comfortable i had a king sized bed and it was very cozy i found the cost for my room to be very economical for the room the rooms reminded me of a kimpton hotel the staff was very nice also this hotel is very close to the action on the south beach strip and beach it is literally a block away it is also a very short walking distance to shops of all sorts i didnt have a car on this trip but i easily shopped and visited zara walgreens bank atm vegan store sunglass hut the beach etcnote you have to put your luggage on a life and then walk up a flight of stairs to meet your luggage this is no big deal for me but others might find this to be a choremy wife and i flew into miami one day before we left on a cruise and she found this hotel based off of the great reviews it has but we have been nothing but disappointed the hotel staff were extremely rude and they said they would watch our bags before we checked in but what they meant was we could leave them completely unattended in a hallway there is no one on duty overnight this place is some hole in the wall shady place and we will not be backwe went there for one night as we arrived from switzerland by plane the hotel is small bit shiny but the place where you can have breakfast is tiny and pretty dark the variaty is also very limited we know that south beach is the in place of the party scene in miami and for that reason we also exspected of course not a silent surrounding but when youre lying in bed and you have the feeling that every car from ocean drive is actually driving through your room then you know how we felt we had a double room that was clean and big but the old art deco building should get a soundproof update asap for the money weve paied we can not recommend this hotel for this overrated high price location you definitly get better and nicer hotels close by for less money so it was a ok experience with less sleepsmall 11 rooms but nice hotel located one block behind ocean drive helpful staff who arranged a highclass transport to the airport for only 35 breakfast was served from 8 to 10 and in the afternoon you could enjoy a glass of wine in the lobby homely touches that makes it the room was large updated and hade comfy bed and pillowsthe negative was that it was very thin wallsmy husband and i stayed one night here before our cruise we were greeted with a bottle of water after our flight they took had us sit in comfortably chairs as they got our bags and checked us in our room was beautifully decorated and spacious other reviewers complained of noise at night but we did not have an issue it is right on south beach so you cant control others and how much noise they make outside we did see homeless folks sleeping right next to the front door of the hotel but it was not unsafe as the door and elevator for luggage are locked when staff leaves for the evening checkout was quick and easy they also allowed us to leave luggage after checkout we have several hours between checkout and boarding our ship we wanted to continue to explore the city staff was great thank you looking forward to another visit the hotel is amazing been there a couple times and always perfect its a small hotel but meets expectations the bedroom is modern clean and knit the staff is friendly and always willing to help with a big smile on the face all of them  marina felipe  but i would like to point osama who is extremely helpful great to solve problems and an outstading posture just as we expect from a hotel staff and as a bonus they prepared an amazing suprise for us the hotel has a really toughtful and caring staff and the manager daniel is doing a great job ithaca thanks for being there in south beach for us about the bad part in my opinion is already ridiculous enough for you to pay to stay in a hotel and is not a 24 hours stay each day more hotels are decreasing the amount of hours ive been to one that check in was 1600 and check out 1000 what is ridiculous but i arrived 8am and wasnt charged early check in ithaca has a 3pm check in and 11am check out which i understand because if every hotel does it so will it and is acceptable so the hotel have time to prepare the rooms etc but to charge for an early check in or late check out if you have the rooms available its just too cheap and i think is unacceptable enough to decrease the hours plus you get charged for arrive early in what should be your right it was really dissapointing i mean it really dissapointing that ithaca wanted to charge me 30 dollars for early check in my 115pm arrival its not about the money it just seems like excess of greed as if you dont care much about the customer well being as you care about the profit and even though we ll know it works like this nobody wants to feel that posture from a hotelwe had a lovely stay the desk clerk let us in early and while we had a king suite it had a futon that my two kids could share better them than me we stayed one night only we chose this hotel for south beach access and to expose the kids to something outside the norm the hotel is stylish and has great access to pedestrian walking and sightseeing this area was rather noisy with what seemed road and construction clanks and clangs overall i would stay again and we had a great time best location in south beach very good room bed shower and breakfast the hotel is close to a lot of good restaurants and the main stores in miami staff very friendly spent only two nights but its my first option in miami beach excellent hotelwe stayed here for 2 weeks in decemberwe had a lovely spacious clean room and everyone was very friendly and helpfulit was a bit noisy and they need to invest in blackout blinds or curtains as our room was very light when trying to sleepbreakfast was continental and very boringno cereal which was disappointing but we didnt let it spoil our staywe would stay here again if we came back to miami as its central to everything and very good valueon the whole we would recommend this hotel but only for a 1 night stay \n",

            "Paragraph:    we had so many issues arise with our trip and one of them was here there was miscommunication about the number of beds in the room thankfully the manager was able to work it out we will definitely be returning here this was our first time in a bb and i must say if i ever stay in any other bb they have some tough shoes to fill if you are into a small clean room near south beach and you dont mind spending 250 each night then this ur spot be warned that 6ou will be charged an extra 5 just for using your credit card the pros are that you receive free parking which is a great 30 value you do get a breakfast consisting of orange juice coffee parfait with plain yogurt and your choice of 1 pancake or a super small omelette afterwards the same person that serves you breakfast cleans your room which i found odd but to be expected at a bb the worst part was not being able to control the temperature of your room if u like the room temp to fluctuate between 60 and 75 degrees then this is your hotel i liked the out door jacuzzi which was only on during one of our nights i also liked the evening wine hour between 67 that was nice as well do i think it is worth 250 a night no way jose i would rather stay at the eb hotel which close to the airport at half the cost i absolutely hate small rooms whose temp i cannot contol this bb was so clean our first day was wonderful welcoming clean quiet lovely courtyard room was small but we were ok with that because of everything else ac was difficult to control at night our first breakfast was fabulous so many nice little touches like early coffee several kinds of fruit on parfait and sprinkling of confections sugar had breakfast all out and organized by 8 tables set up nice but the second morning none of the niceties staff complained that we waned a coffee before 830 skimpy on the fruit and spinach no sprinkling of powdered sugar nothing even up and going till after 8 sat for a while before coffee was even ready kind of a let down after such a nice welcoming morning the morning before would we come back yes wed give it another try spent 1 night during our layover from key west to fort myers rooms are clean and nicely furnished its located within 10 minutes of walk from ocean drive free parking on the streets with residence permit issued on arrival carlos from the front desk was super friendly and recommended some nice restaurants where you dont get ripped off overall definetly recommendable bars bb has wonderful friendly staff always trying to help their customers the room we stayed in was excellent the breakfasts were excellent and the offer of assistance to find our way around miami beach or select restaurants was very helpful the setting of the bb is very good  its location in miami beach and the area in back where guests are invited to linger all goodbars bb would get five stars from me rather than four if they had been able to fix the air conditioning in the room where our friends stayed our room was fine and the cooling was effective without being dominant in any way but in our friends room it failed to cool and the staff just wasnt able to fix it otherwise all was very very goodstayed for a couple of weekday nights reserved trough expedia and choose this place because the description indicated that parking was included after a 4 hour ride to get there we arrived around 730p only to be told that there was no parking and that i should have called in advance to reserve a parking spot as they have a limited amount of parking spaces available i have traveled extensively and this is the first time i have been told this the staff in charge that night was helpful but it was frustrating trying to explain that nowhere in expedia it was indicated that i needed to call to reserve a parking spot in fact it clearly said free parking which was the main reason i opted for this place the person kept pointing out that we needed to park in a nearby garage and never acknowledge what we we just explaining to him well we had no choice but to park in that garage which was around 20 per night at least we got 20 back for each day that we parked there our room was extremely clean with ac restroom fridge and a nice welcome note when we went to the bathroom there was no light and the shower was clogged but it was already late because of all the parking hassle so we decided to report this next day breakfast starts at 830a which is a bit late if you want to have an early start but the service was good as well as the food the lights in our restroom were fixed next day in the afternoon but the shower remained clogged for our whole stay the beach is about a 15 minute walk and there is a grocery store a block and a half away which is where we parked our car the patio area is nice but smoking is allowed so we were not able to enjoy at full for instance we were going to have our breakfast outside but a couple that arrived after us sat in a nearby table and started smoking we waited but it was pretty nasty so we decided to have breakfast inside a shame as it was a beautiful morning perfect for breakfast al fresco all in all we paid 159 per night too much for what we got and again the description of the property indicates that parking is available so if this is not accurate it should be corrected immediately as we would have stayed in a different place if we knew about the parking situationwe have booked our stay with bookingcom arriving late our room was overbooked so we could move to an appartment without comfort next day we could move to bb the nice owner was sorry and did offer us the first day free and next day discount at home we saw our creditcarddetails and payed twicewe maked contact about this but get no response very disapointedmy best place to stay near miami beach  small very cozy place with extremely service my minded staff  even a jacuzzi in the backyard  breakfast special made per order  walking distance to the beachmy girlfriend and i stayed here for 4 days and id recommend this place to anyone the service was extremely good everyone is really kind and goes out of their way to help you the room was nice and comfortable with a modern bathroom they also provide a great complementary breakfast and wine whenever you want there was even sun screen and bug spray providedfantastic place  unbelievable staffthe hotel is immaculate we met with charlie who is an absolute gentlemen  he looked after us so well and is a credit to the hotel we also met with carlos  what a guy loads of stories and could not do enough for us eitherbreakfast was included  i had the best omelette i have ever tasted  cannot stress how nice this waswe had an issue with the plumbing in the room which was sorted with a professional plumber  the room was then cleaned intensively and this service is also a credit to the establishmentthe grounds are beautiful with a jacuzzi hot tub in the gardenall staff were great parking included at the hotel great food when we go back to miami  we would gladly stay here for a weekwe had one of the internal rooms where the air con is controlled by the lobby temperature it was slightly warmer than i prefer but i like an ice box the missus was very happy and contentthanks for a great stay  we can not recommend this place enough stop looking and book herethais pronounced taheees carlos and the rest of the staff were absolutely amazing they made sure that everything was always perfect and remembered special details the overall customer service was excellent they even provided champagne and chocolates the daily breakfast was delicious and the location is a short distance from many of the best spots of sobemiami beach but its also situated away from all of the noise and commotion of ocean drive or collins ave the housekeeping staff was also excellent and made sure that our room was always spotless i cannot say enough wonderful things about bars bb if youre coming to sobe you absolutely must stay here you wont be disappointed and ill definitely be back soonset back a few blocks from ocean drive which depending on your needs can be a good thing so the noise from the nightlife does not effect your stay or a bad thing if you dont fancy a walk to get to the main area of south beach parking is available in the nearby streets with a parking permit from the property we stayed in room 8 a garden room away from the main house it was very clean and cool all white and silver decor very stylish fitted with probably the best efficient air con unit we have encounteredbreakfast is served in the garden there is also indoor seating available excellently presented and prepared by very friendly staffon checking in we were given excellent information about all things south beach with places to visit and eat discussed in fact every member of staff we encountered were helpful and engaging the only thing that this place could benefit from if it had the space would be an outdoor pool however it does offer a jacuzzi in the garden and also provides beach towels and other beach accessories if needed the photograph of the frog was added just because he waited near our door for us to come in on a night which was a nice touch although not sure if all rooms come with one this was our third stay at the bars bb and it is always an amazing experience the inn keepers are incredibly nice and the food is great we stayed for their valentines day special this time and the food was amazing when we got back from dinner they had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting in our room it was very romantic and relaxing if your looking for a relaxing getaway in the heart of south beach this is itwe loved our stay at bars bb charlie and carlos were exceptional hosts we cant wait to see them again we loved everything about this wonderful place the food ambience friendliness our room the staff outdoor courtyard with relaxing musicall contributed to our memorable stay please keep the light on for we will be returning love and namaste to all angie and philwe dont often stay at bbs usually opting for hotels but having read the reviews here we decided to give it a go we were not disappointed bars bb is every bit as good as the reviews here suggest the rooms and the building as a whole are spotlessly clean the staff are the friendliest i have ever met especially carlos who met us every evening with a cheerful smile a chat a glass of wine and some nibbles the friendliness of the place rubbed off on other guests who often sat in the common area socialising the location is perfect just a short walk away from atlantic boulevard to the east the free shuttle street car on the west and lincoln road shopping mall to the north access to downtown miami is also easy on the local buses this was a great find i would highly recomend to anyone staying near south beachextremely happy to have found this peaceful bb close to south beach everyone was friendly and helpful excellent breakfast wine in the evening but only 10 minutes promenade to ocean drive perfectjust a few blocks from the beach in the residential part of town this place is a gem small cleansecure and the staff is so good its a family business with some hired help the breakfast is very nice and made to order eggsomelettes with ham andor cheese and pancakes there is a small patio to sit outdoors and a hot tub out back as well beds and pillows are very comfortable the proce is reasonable it all adds up to perfectionsadly we only stayed 2 nights but we had time to joke with marlon and charly they helped us a lot to find best restaurants and place to gothe bb is just 10 mns away from ocean drive lincoln roadthis is the bb in miami beach dont missed itwe had a fantastic stay at bars bb  downtown miami south beach but still away from the crowd 10 mons walk to oceandrive fantastic welcome great rooms great winehour with small snacks breakfast individually made with everything you wish to have would definately stay here again when visiting miamimy husband and i booked an overnight stay at bars bb south beach hotel the hotel is gorgeous the bed was very comfortable the room was very clean and beautiful it had modern decor charlie was very friendly and very helpful i enjoyed a glass of wine and cheese and crackers after returning from the beach the breakfast the next morning was amazing we started with coffee toast and a fruit plate after that we were asked to order eggs pancakes omelette whatever we wanted food was delicious the entire staff was outstanding and went above and beyond the service was truly exceptional the outside garden is just beautiful with a hot tub to enjoy if you chose i highly recommend this hotel i will definitely come back again we both recently stayed here and highly recommend bars bb carlos is an exceptional person with an outstanding personality what a kind man carlos made us feel most welcome and gave us some interesting information and two glasses of wine each breakfast was excellent and we ate outside in the glorious garden truly amazing the whole place has a relaxed and friendly atmosphere truly a special team we will stay here again if we visit miami in the future the whole area has a safe friendly feel about it lots of walking thank you carlos it was great to meet you and hoped you speared some fish for dinner xmy friend and i stayed here and it was amazing the location is about 6 blocks from the beach and takes about 15 minutes to walk there the staff were incredibly nice and even baked fresh brownies for everyone daily the free breakfast was awesome and consisted of orange juice coffee a fresh fruit plate and your choice of either eggs or pancakes both of which were delicious the one lady at the front desk i believe her name was teris was so nice and helpful we went to the affiliated hostel to go out one night and they offered free cocktails the outdoor area is also amazing highly recommend the b b was an absolute gem we got in after a tiring day of wandering and were welcomed with warmth and a glass of wine the room was lovely theres a pleasant patio and courtyard best of all the staff was unfailingly welcoming kind and helpfulwe stayed here for one night in miami and we only wish we had more timefirstly when we arrived earlier than check in we were given the option of having a room in the bb or an apartment nearby depending on which would suit us with the car we opted for the room in the bb after seeing how beautifully decorated it waswe were offered cold lemonade or wine to drink and they kept our luggage for us while we went to the beach we were given beach towels to take and they also helped us out with getting a parking placewhen we came back they greeted us like we had known them forever it was really nice our room was perfect nicer than some of the expensive hotels we had stayed in it was really clean and we were given bathrobes and fresh fluffy towelswe went on the night out arranged by the sister hostel to this miami international a taxi was arranged for free to take us to the hostel so that we could join the night out we had a great night out for 20 it was free drinks at the hostel a rooftop bar party bus then vip room in a clubwhen we woke up for breakfast the next morning we were offered pancakes omelette fresh juice fruit yoghurt whatever we wantedwe also used the hot tub which was great after a day of walking aroundwhen we checked out they couldnt have been more friendly they made sure we still had beach towels to enjoy our day and we were able to leave the car there until we were back again when we came back we were free to use the facilities have a drink use the outside shower etc it was just a perfect stay with probably the best service we experienced during our whole trip to the usathanks so much for such a good time  we will be recommending to anyone who wishes to stay in miami and we will hopefully be visiting againwhats an amaizing surprise  if i could i ll give 10 stars i really recommand everybody to choose this place to stay in miami beach everythings is new there so be sure that everythings is very clean and bedrooms are very beautifull and trendy the must are the employees who are so nice and always very helpful for everythings they make all for you can be confortable during your staythe atmosphere is great you can feel very relax and really like you are in vacation there is a jacuzzi and little space where you can stay and enjoy the moment the breakfast is awesome fruits pancakes toasts coffee orange juice omelet all is made home and they ask you what you want i been there with my family and we had an amaizing time there and felt like we was homeyou feel very in security because there is lot of cameras outside top of that it is very close to the beach and the downtown of miami beach it is definitely better than an hotel because you not feel close in a room it is really like a cute little house with awesome servicesthanks you very much bars bb was amazing and definitely the highlight of our month holiday to usa it is a shame we were only able to stay two nights as we would have loved to stay longer the location is perfect and very central to free bus and walking distance from beach the rooms are immaculate and very comfortable the breakfast offered is delicious and served with a smile charlie was awesome and provided us with five star service throughout our short stay he was very attentive to our needs and so cheerful he helped us with sight seeing in room queries and even to print last minute travel documents we felt very special staying here and would highly recommend this accommodation when staying in miamibars bb is a renovated home in a quiet neighborhood that is well away from ocean ave it is a within easy walking distance of the action and the beach less than a half mile away this boutique hotel is very quaint and attractively decorated the hosts and employees were all extremely warm and friendly and helpful some of them speak rather limited english so that can present a challenge at times for nonspanish speaking guests but all of them are absolutely trying to be helpful the rooms are small but very nice everything is spotlessly clean the beds appear to be double beds so they are rather small for an adult couple the mattress cover is some kind of easily compressed foam if you are a stomach sleeper it may not be so comfortable on your back it was good it definitely is a soft mattress on the spectrum from soft to firm the breakfast in the morning was really delicious it consisted of a first course of fresh fruit then eggs prepared to your choice scrambled fried etc and then a pancake everything was excellent there is not much sound insulation in the walls although you are in a quiet neighborhood where street noise is not much of an issue you do hear sounds from elsewhere in the bb toilet flushing someone in the lobby area etc on balance however all of the negatives are minor it is a warm and friendly place with great hosts and perhaps most of all it is a really good value for an overnight stay in miami beachhad a quick stay for just one night with the family after travelling around in florida what a nice place the best breakfast we had the whole fortnight freshly made for us the rooms are a little small but beautiful and the bathrooms are spacious the location is nice little aside from the worst cruising so we slept like babies not possible in many other places in south beach still a short walk to the beach restaurants and shopping streets and the staff is just phenomenal would definitely come back and recommend highlyi stayed in room 6  twice over the thanksgiving holiday traveling in south florida i stayed beginning and end of holiday  easy walk to ocean ave  i went back because of the elegant minimalist interiors  gloss white tile floors and doors great detailing original artwork lovely courtyard  major mural dominating end wall and clever landscapingthis place is amazing we were treated extremely well by an allfriendly and very capable staff room was beautiful as was the patio where a very tasty breakfast is served daily 10 minute walk to the beach and south beach restaurants we didnt need a car as so much was available within walking range quiet neighborhood but close to the action at south beach would eagerly book there again excellen value toowe arrived in miami after a hire car drive from orlando took about 4 hourswe were greeted by thais on the front desk who explained everything to us went out in the evening and returned and met carlos again lovely chap very hospitable and chatty so nice to meet friendly staff who care property is v clean and amazing beds are so comfortable too highly recommend stayed there for one night very friendly staff but this was my first time staying at a bb so opinion may be biased place was clean but seemed small to me they have a quiet policy between 10pm and i believe 6am so dont be surprised their breakfast was good good location as theres a publix pharmacy around the corner restaurants and beach a couple of blocks away  good 1520 mnte walkbooked via tripadvisor due to its location to the art deco area and it was one of the few places that has parkingthe art deco area and beach front was a pleasant 10 mins walkarrival very welcoming and room very modern and cleanshower was excellent breakfast was very good service throughout our stay was friendly personal and efficient and if we ever return to miami beach we would certainly stay herewe stayed here for three nights following a cruise because we disembarked from the cruise early we arrived here midmorning we were immediately greeted by charlie who couldnt have been more friendly of course our room wasnt ready but he said we could leave our luggage and offered us coffee we stayed in one of the two rooms in an outbuilding in the garden it was simply furnished but had a great shower be aware though that there was no door between the bedroom and shower so you would need to be comfortable with that breakfast with a choice of dishes was prepared freshly every morning and you could choose to have it in the garden or indoors there was also a happy hour with free wine and snacks every afternoon everyone was really friendly there is a supermarket a couple of minutes walk away and south beach was about 10 to 15 minutes walk away there is also a free trolley which goes from outside the supermarket on a loop around south beach we would definitely stay here againon a whim i decided to do something a little different on our recent visit to miami everything about this place was great we felt right at home when we met carlitos at the gate what a fantastic host how refreshing it is to go to a place that is so hospitablethe room was comfortable the lobby was very inviting once we checked in had a glass of wine carlos said that he would show us to the sixth floor yes room sixbeautiful patio that was a fantastic spot to relax when we returned for our walk to dinner and the beach clean welcoming and great hosts will definitely return the next time we are in miaminice and clean rooms and a five star personalized breakfast the yogurt with fruit and cereals was a mustcomplementary wine and snacks at the end of the day just helped the experiencewonderful staffthanks for an wonderful time we only stayed here one night and would only stay here one nightthe room is not suitable for more than 2 persons although it was a doublei think they need to put in a single as there is no room to store luggage or any tables or chairsthere is a corner unit which was uselessbeds and room were clean as was the housethe outside space was cool with little geckos running aroundbreakfast was delicious and coffee was not hotthe staff were very kindand no safe so we had to cart our cash aroundall in all a 35still my favourite place in south beach had a wonderful stay with my family beach was a short walk away and everything was perfect including the wine at happy hour  thais was an amazing host and the staff were very pleasant cant wait to come back would highly recommendit was refreshing to walk into such a beautiful clean and inviting space the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating breakfast was amazing there were a variety of items to choose from and the presentation was lovely my boyfriend and i stayed here for one night and we were very pleased with our stay a charming quiet place with an amazing backyard good location clean delicious breakfast and the staff was helpful and super friendly when we got back from dinner we got a nice glass of wine on the house and the sweet lady in the reception made the jacuzzi ready for us we really recommend this bb we booked this based on the reviews and werent disappointed we arrived early and charley couldnt have been more helpful he sorted parking on the street told us all about the areas to visit and even found us a bar with a live band when we asked he phoned to check what time the band was on  great service more than that  we were offered free glasses of wine while we relaxed in the nice garden the breakfast was great  the best by far that we had on our 11day tour of southern florida and the keys our room was just off reception so it was a little noisy one night when some guests arrived back late but no big deal we parked on the street as mentioned but didnt have any trouble finding a space a great three nights check in time there was one lady who didnt speak english we had to use google translate to talk to her about checking in and where to park didnt work so i left to get lunch  i came back 2 hours later to find someone who spoke english she let me borrow the umbrella and chairs for the beach but she was not friendly or welcoming parking is a block and half away behind a building  i had to text her back and forth with pictures of my car parked to make sure i was at the right spotdont get me starred on the ac it sounded like a plane engine and i barely slept due to the noise it made it was so loud and i just couldnt wait to leave that bb it was just awful and the sink was not draining in the bathroom breakfast was ok i would not recommend staying here again  and i was really disappointed especially with the high ratings this place has i just dont see how  im confusedi was there with my friend on vacation had a very nice time all the staff is super friendly and helpful they go a long way to make sure you enjoy your stay breakfast is complete free wine is a good plus theres also the beautiful patio with the spa all and all a very nice place this was the second time we stayed in this bb and we loved it we only stayed here for one day last time we stayed longer as we were only one day in miami excellent service nice room we had the one in the back very good breakfast great wifi and friendly staff its a quiet neighborhood at walking distance from the shops and south beach also enough parking space if you have a rental carwe had a great time here the room was spotless and really nicely furnished beds were extremely comfortablethe service was really friendly they went above and beyond to make our time there enjoyablea lovely twist on a traditional bb great location and very helpful staff carlos and charlie in particular staff are there 24 hours and nothing is too much trouble a very short walk to the beach and nice relaxation area out the back with a hot tub if youre in the mood generous sized fridge in the room and comfortable bed my only complaint would be that there is little privacy rooms right next to each other opening to a central area and the towels have seen better days however i wouldnt hesitate to stay here again great value for moneyi really enjoy this hotel beautiful house great customer service the back area is cozy and peacefully they have a bathtub break was delicious all rooms looked confortable but room 5 they are two beds full beds in a small spaces no place for suit case neither to walkwe founf this small parodies on line last minute to go to a aa arena concertfurts you need to know im the pickyest of the pickyest carlos and all the staff really make you feel you are at home beautiful bedroom and comfortable bed i would absolutly stay here again for our next concert i would also recommend to anybody that is looking for clean good service and good price the breakfast that is included was wonderful fresh made to order just love the placethis place is really awesome the rooms are brand new clean and very charming consider that in miami beach most places are old and ugly breakfast is really good and mr carlos  charlie are super accommodating and very nice persons i would totally recommend this lovely boutique accommodation you will feel like at home with all hotel services availableeven more thanks to the owners touch luca thank you for letting us stay at your beautiful place the rooms where so nice and christina and theies where wonderful to us they gave us a very nice breakfast every morning and a glas of wine in the evening thank you both of you we booked the king room via airbnb for a wednesday night in mid june we got a good price for miami beach we were greeted by a sweet lady who didnt speak english but she showed us to our room and let us settle all of the staff were very nice ms attentive the room was clean it smelt like cleaning products which to me was a good sign at first the room looked five star but some little things brought it down there was no cable there was no trash can there was no where to put our stuff bags keys purse etc there were no outlets to charge phones or plug in a hair dryer however the ac was great the bathroom was big and the bed was comfy on our way out to yoga class we met the front desk attendant who was very pleasant she went over all the details about parking entryexit breakfast etc we talked about wanting to use the hot tub on our return and she said shed turn it on and have wine and cheese for the guests to enjoy we returned and the hot tub was open but not hot we turned the heater on and when an hour later it was warm we got in it burned our skin and felt like someone had poured bleach in there this was very disappointing as the hot tub was the main reason we booked this place  there was also no wine in sight the garden oasis was covered in leaves and there were big bags of trash left in plain view we woke up the next morning and i went to the kitchen to find coffee i wish the coffee had been more easily accessible we waited until 830 for them to start offering breakfast but it was nice we sat outside and the lady took our order the food was fresh and was a nice surprise overall we had a nice stay if there were a few upgrades sweep leaves put trash away get cable etc it could be a five starthis place is amazing very welcoming friendly attentive staff ti and charlie are amazing and provide exceptional service location is close to everything yet in a neighborhood which is perfect place was very clean and comfortable breakfast is made to order omelette coffee orange juice toast yogurt with granola and fresh fruit simply delicious love this place simply cant say enough good things about it service and location were excellent a little bit noisy as the rooms in front all face the front desk and front door anyone coming in will make some noise the gentleman that checked us in was very attentive and the breakfast was good service was excellent and they let us stow luggage at the hotel early before check in and after check outwe had a wonderfull stay at this hotel and that was because of the super friendly straffthe breakfast was really good and served in the back yard the place was situated in a nice and calme environment \n",

concierge nury this place would be great for couples it is 1 block from the beach which makes it very convenient breakfast and pool were greatamazing time spent in miami hotel is conveniently located 1 minute from the beach great walking distance to the nearest walgreens and starbucks happy hour did not disappoint barok restaurant was so good my husband and i was greeted very nice and linanet helped us out with check in and was a great help alongside suellen our room was nice and cozy for a couple and the cleaning staff did not disappointnury was very helpful and very attentive with helping us check into the hotel she made sure we had everything we needed and more the ambience of the hotel is artistic chic the rooms are very spacious and have the same artistic decor the bed are so comfortable its addictive the restaurant was amazing anything we needed nury was extremely accommodating i will definitely return i highly recommend red south beach hotelthe staff was great very attentive and courteous the concierge was awesome her name is nury she and patriciazegnidaand lianett was the best we had to stay over and extra day and they were very accommodating i love them and the hotel we didnt have for anything at no pointred south beach hotelwe stayed 2 nights prior to a cruise and hotel was booked via our ta and perhaps not my first choice before travelling i had followed the comments on trip advisor and was quite anxious as to what standard i would find i need not have worried  the hotel was absolutely fine the reception staff were as others have commented extremely friendly and the hotel is about 5 minutes away from the beach there are two small supermarkets an italian restaurant a subway wine shop and a coffee shop again about 5 minutes walk  turn right outside the hotel big bus and trolley bus stop is literally across the road outside the riu hotel the breakfast for 10 was fine  yes a bit limited but what do you expect for 10 and the free cocktail was very nice  my first ever tequila sunrise which is now my drink of choice our room was the smallest on offer and it was fine  bed was extremely comfortable the room was clean and yes although tight you could sit on loohopefully i have helped others dismiss some of the negative comments written about this hotel red south beach is a lovely friendly clean well located boutique hotel book with confidence and enjoy stayed here just me and my daughter for her 12th birthday gift and the service was absolutely brilliant as a service manager myself i always judge the service being offered to me in any given environment and these guys were great from concierge to janitors and housekeeping they all greeted us with smiles and hola everyday i left my phone in the taxi on arrival and after helping me call around to find the driver who had it nuri on the front desk offered to pay the 35 taxi fare from her own pocket for him to bring it back later that day so we could go to beach and not miss out on a sunny day waiting in reception for the driver to return she and her manager zaniada also gave us breakfast vouchers on the day of my daughters birthday and secretly went to our room and dressed it with some balloons as a surprise for when we went back up this kind of service just isnt found these days if i had to balance the review and add a negative i would just say that the decor is a little odd and mishmash so if you are staying here and want to be blown away by interior design its probably not for you however if you want amazing service kind and smiling staff clean rooms decent food and a location which is just a minute walk to south beach all at a price point which this place enters at then id recommend red south beach also if youve never been to miami before and worried about location again its across the street from the beach and the miami beach trolly a free bus service stops outside and runs down to lincoln road outside mall in less than 10 minutes otherwise a 20 minutes walk overall a fantastic experience and one i hope to repeat next february to escape the dreary grey british weathervery good service  really friendly staff good beach location across the road 5 min walk to supermarket liquor store simple restaurantsvery nice interior design free bus to centre swimming pooltowells for pool  beach provided free of chargewe made 2 reservations for this hotel through groupon we arrived at 10am and nury was great she let us check in early to 1 room with no additional fee also she gave us vouchers for free breakfast the food was cold but the service was great the waitress had the chef make us some fresh pancakes since there were none left the place is cute love the egg chairs in the lobby this was al before we made it to the room go to this hotel and check in with nuryi spent 4 nights with breakfast included very nice and convenient location 5 min walking to miami beach the hotel features swimming pool and nice art decoration bedrooms are comfortable but not insulated against noise outdoors the staff is very friendly and zeinaida the manager very welcoming and service oriented and recommended us sightseeing tourstriple a is what i can say about our stay the red amazing accomodating ass kicking stafffun and friendly first i went on a quick getaway to miami to escape the freezing cold of the north what a great trip it was i really enjoyed the red for its authentic look lounge is always clean when we wait to check in the room was nicely set up and spacious the front desk staff are always smiling and helpful we also got to do some things we didnt get to last time nury the concierge booked us a city of miami tour and a trip to the everglades my wife and i were happy especially my daughter i had issues with the hot water in the room and nury helped resolve it she always greeted us with a big smile and greeted us when we came to the hotel another employee named felix helped me open the safe all in all my visit to the red was a wonderful timemy daughter loved the pool like any child would have the drinks from 5 to 7 were priced fair and while i drank my grey goose my wife had a cosmo poolside the miami scene would not be the same if it wasnt for the stay at the red as our preferred choice to stay thank you for making my family feel welcome and the wonderful experience 100 satisfied highly recommend the hotelthis hotel is great the staff is friendly and extremely helpful the free breakfast is tasty and filling nury the concierge is amazing she is nice and is very accommodating she helped us with all our needs the hotel is very clean the rooms are clean and i will be back with my husband i love it here and its not far from everything plus the price is right the bar and the pool is poppingi had a great experience rooms were spot on clean great customer service i want to thank zeneida for her awesome customer service skills love that it was quite was able to sleep with no problems comfortable beds our stay at red south beach was absolutely the best the front desk staff was great especially nury she was very helpful in accommodating my family and i also very helpful answering any questions the hotel is very clean and is in a ideal location the pool was clean and enjoyable close to buses and trolleys to explore miamis south beach i highly recommended this hotel the only thing i didnt like was having to leave thank you red south beach hotelthe staff was friendly inviting and engaged you in conversation desk offered towels and chairs and a place to change prior to checkin room was clean nicely appointed one block to the beach rate included full buffet breakfasti had the misfortune of staying at this hotel during new years because the hotels we like to stay at were sold out i honestly feel lucky to never have to ever stay in hotels like this and that the rates were higher for new years bringing in a better clientele because the day we checked out the people checking in were questionable if you let people walk into your hotel with no shirt on pants so low you can see their underwear swinging a half empty patron bottle around then good luck to you now while its a 3 star so i knew it was going to be bad compared to what im used to but this place is absolutely horrendous the beds are so hard and uncomfortable we actually woke up in pain and my neck is still sore from it now the rooms have all carpet gross there are no curtains so all you have to block light is a shutter so the only time the room is darkened is at night time and even then its not dark because of the street lamps curtains also provide noise blocking so of course you can hear everything from outside the bathroom is so small that you cannot sit on the toilet straight because your legs will hit the bath the toilet is rusted out at the bottom so it looks dirty the rain head shower is placed up so high that all you get is a little trickle so washing takes forever and almost impossible to wash long hair the corridors to lead to the rooms were so tight and dark with low ceilings it was anxiety inducing the worst part of this hotel is the restaurant inside of it  barok where employees like to steal your money i ordered a drink during happy hour which turned out to be very far from happy it was buy one get one free and the drink was 1200 when i got the check i noticed that it was not itemized and the tab was 1700 when i asked the bar tender what made it 17 he said it was taxes and fees i said ok and walked out even though i knew it wasnt right my friend was picking me up so i sat in the lobby next to the restaurant and overheard the bartender and server talking about me first in spanish and then in english because they didnt realize i was right there they were complaining about me asking why it was 17 and she shouted that she was sick of people asking why its 17 i went in the restaurant and told them i could hear them talking about me and she instantly became defensive and rude and started shouting like excuse me and i told her if she was sick of explaining to people then they should itemize the receipt so people can see clearly where their money is going you need to shut up and get the f out of my restaurant was her response to that i turned to leave because im not going to argue with some uneducated server and she said yeah thats right keep walking as i walk out this happened on december the 30th at around 530pm when i told the reception staff they apologized and tried to find the owner for me but he wasnt there and she told me if i saw him to tell him thats not my job clearly no one in this hotel cares about hospitality and they need to take a serious look at their employees because that isnt how to treat anyone disgusting my husband parents and i stayed for 5 days over christmasi felt the price was reasonable for the 3 rating relative to miami being expensive anyway and the xmas spikelets start with the positivesthe location was great  across road from the beach and near enough to the attractions of south beach without being bang in the middle  and the hotel had a nice pool deck area bright foyer  restaurant and small gym it was clean and breakfast went on until 1030am which was helpful our room was quiet as it didnt face the street but my parents had some noise we had beach towels and chairs every day and for those who like a happy hour drink youre in luck  free one every day 57pmhowever its in need of maintenance we were disappointed on arrival one of the lifts was out of service the other  even given increased use  was extremely slow we had trouble connecting to wifi and it was off and on my parents air con was too cold and couldnt be turned off there was no tea making facilities in the room but being english in the us perhaps were expecting too much the breakfast was ok if you enjoy carbs and heavier food but could have had more fruit muesli etc it wasnt included in our bookingcom price either we would have liked to use the pool but it didnt seem heated or warm enough to swim inthe gym was tiny and in a room with no windowsit was unfortunately that some of the maintenance issues happened over xmas when it was probably hard to find available handymen although all hotels should have them however once we complained my husband and i were given a free bottle of bubbly breakfast included and 1 free night which we appreciated so because the staff were obliging and rectified our complaints overall we felt it was a good experience and we would be happy to recommendi stayed at red south beach last year i would definitely recommend this hotel to others the location is perfect just a few minutes walk to midbeach boardwalk and bus the staff was great nury and zenaida at the front desk were very accommodating and helpful and recommended some great restaurants in the area and south beach towels were readily available and they always had water in the front foyer to refill your bottlethey also offered complimentary happy hour and breakfast was included i had no issues with my room it was always clean and stockedgreat value for the location hospitality and pricewe spent a few day very comfortable in a quiet and pleasant place i highlight the kindness of zenaida and dayana that with their sympathy and kindness made the stay more enjoyable it is highly recommendedstayed here for two nights over christmas breakfast was appalling customer service was non existent and most staff need customer service training worst staff i ever experienced in any hotel resort charge was not explained and when i made the booking wifi was free so this was unnecessary only one lift working which resulted in long delays i have nothing good to say about this hotel but the location great hotel amazing staff super nice location for a quiet and fabulous week with the beach just a block away from the hotel zenaida alvarez went beyond any expectations making us feel like we were part of her family she was more than special and her customer service was perfect defenitly she was the sweetest person on staff i also want to mention nury gomez that she always was there to help us with any questions we had she is very sweet and made us feel like home thank you to everyone who made our stay so peaceful and enjoyable i would definitely recommend itmy stay at the red was amazing i couldnt be happier rooms were very clean and the customer service was amazing and special thanks to mayka amazing young lady very outgoing and funny  will visit again i really enjoyed my stay the staff was very pleasant great location beach across the stree great hotel decor breakfast every morning was good appetizers and drinks at night by the bar there was also a lovely patio to sit outside and take in the fresh airnice comfortable quirky hotel across the road from a lovely sandy beach rooms a decent size with coffee making facilities iron ironing board and toiletries in a quietish area but a good half hours walk from the livelier area with lots of shops restaurantsstaff were very helpful and mostly pleasantthe young lady nury at the front desk was very helpfulthe food was great and we were able to walk to the beach i believe it was a 23 minute walk also i loved the art work on the walls very colorfulhotel is clean room spacious but bathroom very small excellent air conditioning decor very questionable but humorous two extremes with staff some will go above and beyond to help you and others are rude and unwilling to help breakfast is included basic but enough to keep you going til lunch pool is small with sun loungers but we never had a problem getting a sun lounger it is a 3 min walk to the beach 2030 min walk to the centre of south beach however there is plenty of transport options we used to get the free miami beach trolley which brings you right to the center we were supposed to stay here for a 2 night stop over before going on a cruise for this purpose this hotel is ideal however on our trip we ended up staying in miami an extra 3 nights so for a 5 night stay i probably would have looked for nicer accommodation but for a short stay id recommend this hotelfriendly and helpful staffvery lively yet family friendlyrooms are really clean and coolgreat air conditioninga neccesity with the humide climatebest pizza in miamithank you for the best miami experiencemay husband and i stayed at this hotel after a cruise the hotel was close to a bus stop that had buses stop by every 20 minutes you could walk to a path that parallels the beach the breakfast was decent i would recommend this hotelwe stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon the hotel is really cozy and clean and the staff is very attentive to customer needs especially lianet at the reception was really exceptional and kind and helped us to solve an important problem with our shuttle bus to the airporti enjoyed the hotel very much and also the restaurant inside of it the food was of good quality and at good price personalized attention and the manager luigi very nice the front desk supervisor nury is very attentive and her team always smiling you feel at home in this hotel and we will come back sooni looked for the restaurant of this hotel but didnt find it since we arrived the hostess was not very friendlybut we ignored this we were a table of three and ordered a pizza and the salmon only two dishes after over an hour of waiting one of us asked the hostess who said she would check what was going onbut were pretty sure she forgot our order because within 15 minutes of that we had our food the salmon with mashed potatoes my friend had was tasteless and overcooked at least they didnt charge us for this dish since she refused to eat it this is the only reason i am putting two as a rating instead of one but unfortunately she had to go to bed hungry because by the time we were done everything else was closed our pizza was not horrible but it wasnt great either service in general was badafter we ate we had to go inside because the waitresshostess didnt even come to check on us we are never coming back here and we suggest you do yourself a favor and skip this restaurant again this is just a review for the restaurant not the hotelhace muchos aos que paro en ese hotel y realmente estoy muy conforme con la atencin las habitaciones la limpieza y todo en general muchas gracias al gerente luigi rsula y mercedes de reservas  nuri y zenaida de front desk jos augusto del vallet parking y a todos en general lo recomiendo i have been staying at this hotel for many years and i am really happy with the service the rooms the cleaning and everything in general thank you very much to the manager luigi rsula and mercedes for reservations nuri and zenaida for front desk jos and augusto vallet parking and all in general i recommend this hotel i chose this hotel for the fact that they offered a hot breakfast every day that you stayed there now anyone who knows me knows i take my breakfast very seriously do not give me a cookie or a cupcake and call it a day this ended up being the biggest disappointment with my stay breakfast is 730 to 11 and i would get down there about nine and the food was more than halfway gone the first morning i came down i assumed they would be refilling the empty stations that were there there was one tray of scrambled eggs another tray that had three sausage links in it and a third tray that was empty while i was at breakfast no one refilled the food they had a waffle iron to make waffles but if you werent in the mood for a waffle you were out of luck  they also routinely ran out of flatware and plates during the breakfast hours you were left there waiting until someone came in to replenish these needed utensils they seemed to be short staffed throughout my fiveday stay the one bartender was also the person who made bloody marys and mimosas in the morning bussed tables inside the restaurant and also bussed tables outside by the pool also the first night i was there i went down to the restaurant for dinner something light when i asked for the chicken wings i was told that anything that needed to be fried was not available i dont know if their fryer broke but the salad with grilled chicken that i had instead was a not a very good substitute my room was nice large and clean my bed was very comfortable the furnishings and decor seemed to be on the chintzy side but that is something you have to deal with when you do not go with a chain hotel while i was there two of the days my room was never made the first time i called the front desk and they sent someone the second time i just said forget it and dealt with it any of the staff that i interacted with were very nice and accommodating the bartender was a very hard worker so i hope she is compensated accordingly i made sure i added to her tip jar when she waited on me  overall i had a good time while visiting miami this little hotel could do so much too heighten their visitors experience while staying there i hope that they do soi had a very nice experience at red south beach hotel very comfy beds great breakfast a couple blocks to the beach staff was super nice and helpful elevator smelled musky but it worked  the only complaint i have is the glass shower door in the room it doesnt slide open like normal glass doors you have to go inside the tub to turn on the water which was strange not sure if all the rooms are the same but overall great experiencelianet is the best receptionisthotel is good located and the breakfast is goodi will come back for sure hotel is located in collins avenue and not far from the beach 100 meters and 20min walk from ocean drivethis place is awesome from the drinks staff rooms to the all you can eat included breakfast beach was right across the street great price for the location with near by cultural related resturants we loved south beachnury the concierge was simply amazing so nice and easygoing the hotel is a little older and my only complaint is there is a strange smell in the hallways but with that being said i was very pleased with my stay here close to everything on south beach and like i said the staff was so nice from hector the door man to nury and patricia the bartender i felt very appreciated the whole time i was there thank you to the whole staff and i will see you on my next visit amari smithmyself and my partner had booked a week stay well aware that it was a cheaper alternative to the hotels around they gave us complimentary breakfast which we found to be self service which again is not a problem as you get what you paid for one morning we went down to have breakfast as usual we were confronted by a very unorganised layout there were facilities to make waffles however there was no assistance as the machine seemed to be malfunctioning when we asked the manager he went onto explaining it was self service but we only just needed assistance really we then went ahead and sat down trying to have what we found the manager approached us and said hed like to know why we were asking who the manager was and what the problem was while we ate our breakfast he abruptly disturbed us i tried to explain that ill speak to him after wed finished eating but he was very insistent to know what went wrong which we found to be incredibly embarrassing as well as unprofessional other hotel guests were looking over at us and that is clear defamation i would recommend this hotel if you are not looking to spend much and the cleanliness of the rooms were okay too however it is over priced for the facilities provided and the management needs to review their customer servicei stayed with my family in this place my son recommended it to us it was our first time and really a stay to be remembered the rooms were very nice  clean and very comfortable and people were very nice and friendly and always ready to help and answer to our questions and needs breakfast was amazing i wouldnt miss it for nothing it was fresh just prepared and served with care definitely we will be back againhow this hotel has got good reviews is beyond me i stayed for 4 nights and hated it was gutted that i had 4 days before my flight home if you like plastic knives and forks then youre in luck if you like a mish mash continental breakfast which apparently is included in your booking fee then go for it if you like dark corridors to your room then this is the place for you if you dont mind paying out for expensive meals and eating basic food then again this is the place for you the rooms are basic the website photos must be old as there are very little similarities compared with the real picture i would not recommend this hotel to anyone the only good thing about this hotel is the location to the beach i booked the hotel through a vacation app i have secretscapes and was thoroughly happy with our visit when i booked the hotel i didnt take into account that it was going to be spring break in miami beach fl we arrived and the hotel at 11am and went to the desk to ask if there was possibility of an early check in they explained there wasnt any ability to do that but we could check our bags with them grab some beach towels complimentary and head to the beach for a couple hours if we wantedwe got changed in the bathroom and left the bags collected our towels and headed out for some sunwe were coming from philadelphia area in mid march so lots of sun was in orderthe front desk crew were always courteous and helpful the overnight desk guy was always so friendly and happy to see us always a smile on everyones faces we checked in and rested a bit then headed down for the complimentary drink mica at the bar was so friendly and helpful and just a really fun energetic person to be around and chat with at night we made our way down into the madness that was miami beach spring break i cant even comment on this as im sure most people have heard stories about this years goings on after deciding that the lights and sirens and crowds of people all of them probably 20 years younger than myself and my partner were all a little too much crazy for us we went back toward the hotel grabbed a 6 pack of beer up the block and headed to the front sitting area of the hotel where we met benjamin and the other doormen this became our usual hang in the evenings for the rest of our trip as they were such great people and just fun to be around we were there for 4 nights and the accommodations were a fun little change from your usual everyday hotel the lobby mostly in white with bright red accents was a delight the cleaning crew kept the areas gleaming through all the traffic of people in and out an impressive feat in itselfthe morning breakfast offerings were adequate however made things a little less interesting for a vegan but they did have fresh fruit and juice and toast only suggestions i could make would be to have maybe another protein available even just peanut butter for those who dont eat animal protein also for the ones who do it always seemed as though the food was gone or nearly gone and took a while to fill back up the young lady working the breakfast detail was hustling around and was always sweet and helpful and kind and works her butt off there all of the workers are constantly moving and grooving at no time did it seem like any of them were bored or had nothing to do the ownermanagers pointed out to us incidentally because we had overheard a conversation between workers was always friendly and available to the staff they were also quick with a smile or handshake this kind of service is a dream for me when youre on vacation who wants people who are in a bad mood serving or helping them we get enough of that in the cityanyway thank you so much for being so wonderful and if we ever find ourselves in miami beach again be sure we will stay there but most definitely not during spring breaki have been in this hotel for 3 days during an exhibition in miami and i chose it because was quite close to the exhibition center and also to lyncon road when i visit a new hotel i try to understand what is being the style the concept etc but in this case i was not able to provide any replies to my questions the building is very hold even if white painted gives a different impression the staff speaks differs t languages rooms are quite big they have all the amenities but need lot of maintenance because are suffering for broken parts missing parts etc bathrooms are small and really more than the rooms need a lot of maintenance lot of broken parts scratches noise insulation is something very bad i have seen just few other situations like that you can hear people talking in the rooms next to you the temperature of the ac cant be adjusted or you get frozen or ovewarm the blankets of the windows are too small breakfast is cheap and really essential the price of the hotel is too high vs the quality and service only one good and positive points the speed of the internet connection and the kindness of the staff there are other solutions for sure in miami i was really hoping to love this hotelwe are locals and were always looking for a nice hotel on the beach to have staycationsunfortunately this will be our first and last time at this hotelworst part is that it wasnt even about the service we received but the room we were givenit looked nothing like any of the pictures listed hereall the updated showers wood floors updated wood vanities did not exist in the room we were given and the worse part is that when we were checking in the front desk told me they were giving us one of their best roomsvery upsetting experiencehere were the issues we encountered room quality was poor door to the room was located directly in the stairwell we were warned that it was by the stairwell but not clear that the entry was within the stairwell where you had to go through the stairwell door to get to the room door room smelled musky and it may have been because of the carpet in the room plus the ac issues in that room ac was not working upon arriving it was temporarily fixed however upon check out the next day the thermostat was starting to read high temps again beds were comfortable but sheets had a little bit of an odor bathroom sink had some black mold on the rim wall corners looked dirty chair in the room had dried up residue on it pool was very very cold could be because of the weathernone heated pool but when sitting in the pool area looking up at the roof you saw some broken lights and worn outwe had an early check in and during the time of check in the front desk clerk assured that we were being given one of the best rooms in the hotel but considering the above mentioned issues we received far from a great roomthe only positive experience we had there were the friendly valet workerswe really wish we had a better experiencemy girls and i definitely enjoyed our stay at this hotel our room was right next to the pool which was perfect only downfall is that you have to walk a couple blocks to get to ocean drivewhich is fine if you dont mind walkinglovely hotel with a great location and extremely helpful and friendly staff from the staff at the concierge to the valet gentlemen especially jose our overall experience was fantastic would definitely stay againid stay again nothing fancy and value for money food is burgerwings style pleasant casual poolside tables plus a few indoors good breakfast short walk to beach and not too far from anywhere by uberthoroughly enjoyed our recent precruise stay at the red south beach lovely spacious room small but functional bathroom plenty of storage space the pool area is small but with the beautiful beach just a few minutes stroll away it wasnt a problem and there were always beds available when we chose to sit by the pool breakfast was ok the daily free cocktail was a nice touch would stay here again if we return to south beach came on a baecation this boutique hotel is gorgeous not too far from the night life right across the street from the beach our room was great right off the pool with a separate entrance to hotel great for a nice discreet entry n exit the staff were greatclean locationlianett n nury the front desk staff were friendly n very helpful n my room was decorated for my bday which included some champagnewill returni want to say i am pleased with nury nury was very accommodating she listened to all of my wants and needs and followed through i also want to thank my housekeeper she was so sweet she changed my linens when i needed a fresh set all the staff katiana eric  benjamin were all soo great to me thank you red south beach nydianice hotel along collins the room has reasonably priced and exactly what i was looking for on a one evening sleep over in the area thrilled that they had parking and it was not over priced also the mornings breakfast hit the spot elevators are a bit slow but otherwise ideal place to stayi love staying in miami beach when i come visit family in miami but i had never stayed at red south beach what a pleasure it was to discover this super cute boutique hotel right across the street from the beach and it has a pool the staff was super friendly and so accommodating with late check outs and storing luggage my room was exactly what i needed and very clean will definitely be checking in again soonmy husband and i stayed at this hotel because it was close to the beach the beach is one block away our stay was really nice the staff warm and friendly on our first night we had a small issue with the room and the girl in front didnt get her name

south beach staff for making our stay a memorable one \n",
